# Context

Emergence in the last decade(s) of a vibrant ecosystem of *open source
software* for pure mathematics:

- Specialized libraries: GAP, Linbox, Pari/GP, MPIR, Singular, ...

- General purpose systems: Sage, ...

- Online databases: OEIS, LMFDB, ...

- Interactive computing environments:
  IPython/Jupyter, SageMathCloud, ...

- Together with the wider Scientific Python ecosystem

Viable open source alternatives to Maple, Mathematica, Matlab, ... for:

- Research
- Education (in France: lycée $\longrightarrow$ agrégation, ...)
- Industry?

---

## A successful development model ...

- By users, for users

- Indirect funding via research grants

- Large international developer communities (300 for Sage)

## ... with some limitations

- Some highly technical tasks are lagging behind:

- Hard to justify work on them for a researcher

- Hard to justify work on them on a research grant

- Impeding the wide adoption of those systems

---

# Funding needs

## A few full time developers

   Aka [Research Software Engineers]()

## Community building

- Training and development workshops

- Developer visits

# OpenDreamKit (2015-2019)

*Open Digital Research Environment Toolkit
for the Advancement of Mathematics*

[OpenDreamKit.org](OpenDreamKit.org)

- H2020 European Research Infrastructures Work Programme

  Call: Virtual Research Environments

- Budget: 7.6 million euros

- [15 sites, 50 participants](http://opendreamkit.org/partners)

  In close collaboration with the international community!

  [We recruit](http://OpenDreamKit.org/joinus)

---

# Aims

- Foster the ecosystem of open source software for pure mathematics
  and beyond

- Deliver a flexible Virtual Research Environment toolkit supporting
  collaborative work on *software*, *data*, and *knowledge*

- Sustain long term viability by outsourcing components or joining
  forces with the wider community whenever possible

---

# Main tasks

- Modularization and interfaces between systems

- Build, documentation, tests systems

- Portability, distribution, deployment

- High Performance

- Interactive collaborative computing environments

- Mathematical databases

- Research on social aspects of math soft development

- Community building and training
