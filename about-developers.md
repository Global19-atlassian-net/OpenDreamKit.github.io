# OpenDreamKit

## The developer's perspective

# Trends from the last decade(s)

## Emergence of a vibrant ecosystem of **open source software** for pure mathematics

- Specialized libraries: [LinBox](http://www.linalg.org/), [PARI/GP](http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/), [MPIR](http://mpir.org/), [Singular](http://www.singular.uni-kl.de/), ...
- General purpose systems: [GAP](http://www.gap-system.org/), [SageMath](http://www.sagemath.org/), ...
- Online databases: [OEIS](https://oeis.org/), [LMFDB](http://www.lmfdb.org/), ...
- Interactive computing environments:<br>
  [IPython/Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/), [SageMathCloud](https://cloud.sagemath.com/), ...
- Together with the wider Scientific Python ecosystem

--

## Viable alternatives to Maple, Mathematica, Matlab, ...

For:

- Research
- Education
- Industry?

--

## A successful development model ...

- By users, for users
- Indirect funding via research grants and work of permanent researchers and engineers
- Large international developer communities (300 for SageMath)

## ... with some limitations

- Some highly technical tasks are lagging behind:
- Hard to justify work on them for a researcher
- Hard to justify work on them on a research grant
- Impeding the wide adoption of those systems

---

# Funding needs

## A few full time developers

   Aka [Research Software Engineers]()

## Community building

- Training and development workshops
- Developer visits

# OpenDreamKit (2015-2019)

*Open Digital Research Environment Toolkit
for the Advancement of Mathematics*

[OpenDreamKit.org](OpenDreamKit.org)

- [Horizon 2020](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/)
  [European Research Infrastructures](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en/h2020-section/european-research-infrastructures-including-e-infrastructures)<br> Work Programme
  Call: Virtual Research Environments

- Budget: 7.6 million euros

- [15 sites, 50 participants](http://opendreamkit.org/partners)<br>
  In close collaboration with the international community!

- [We are recruiting](/joinus)

# Aims

- Foster the ecosystem of open source software for pure mathematics
  and beyond
- Deliver a flexible Virtual Research Environment toolkit supporting
  collaborative work on *software*, *data*, and *knowledge*
- Sustain long term viability by outsourcing components or joining
  forces with the wider community whenever possible

---

# Main tasks

- Modularization and interfaces between systems
- Build, documentation, tests systems
- Portability, distribution, deployment
- High Performance
- Interactive collaborative computing environments
- Mathematical databases
- Research on social aspects of math soft development
- Community building and training

TODO: link to tasks
