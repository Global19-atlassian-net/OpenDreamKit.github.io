[Jupyter](http://jupyter.org) is an ecosystem of software, standards,
and services for interactive computations
([literate computing](http://blog.fperez.org/2013/04/literate-computing-and-computational.html)).
Its flagship is the Jupyter notebook, a web application for authoring
and sharing documents that contain live code, equations,
visualizations and narrative text.

OpenDreamKit supports and promotes the Jupyter notebook as user
interface of choice for computational (mathematics) software, and in
general the Jupyter ecosystem as building brick for the front-end of
Virtual Research Environments. It contributes actively to the Jupyter
ecosystem, in particular by funding several full time developers in
Europe.
