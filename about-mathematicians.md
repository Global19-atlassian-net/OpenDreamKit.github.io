# Fundamental trends

## Increasing role of computers for mathematics

Even in pure mathematics!

- Computer exploration
- Mechanized proofs
- Proof assistants and certified proofs
- Collaborative work
- Education

TODO: add examples

## Emergence of Open Science

- ...
- Reproducibility

- Open publications: arxiv, ...
- Open source software:

Now recognized as *necessary* and *viable*!

Even by funding agencies :-)

# What are Virtual Research Environments?

A call of the H2020 European Research Infrastructures Work Programme


``Groups of researchers, typically widely dispersed who are working
together through ubiquitous, trusted and easy access to services for
scientific data, computing and networking, in a \emph{collaborative
virtual environment}.''

# Virtual Research Environments for mathematics?

Fact: Mathematicians are already immersed in a multitude of virtual
environments to collaborate on *Software*, *Data*, and *Knowledge*:

# Now, what's next?

Target features:

- Improve the productivity of researchers in pure mathematics and
  applications by further promoting collaborations on **Data**,
  **Knowledge**, and **Software**

- Make it easy for teams of researchers of any size to set up custom,
  collaborative **Virtual Research Environments** tailored to their
  specific needs, resources and workflows

- Support the entire life-cycle of computational work in mathematical
  research, from **initial exploration** to **publication**, **teaching**,
  and **outreach**

- Performance, flexibility, ease of use

- Research on social aspects of collaborative software development in
  mathematics
