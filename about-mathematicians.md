# Some fundamental trends

## Long standing and booming role of computers in pure mathematics

- Computer exploration
- Conjecture verification
- Mechanized proofs
- Proof assistants and certified proofs
- Collaborative work
- Education

<!-- TODO: add examples -->

--
## Open Science getting momentum

> [Open science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science) is the
> movement to make scientific research, data and dissemination
> accessible to all levels of an inquiring society, amateur or
> professional

- Open Knowledge (Access, Educational Ressources)
- Open Source or better Free Software
- Open Data
- Open Peer Review, Methodology, ...

At the core of science for centuries. Finally getting recognition as
*viable* and *necessary*, even by funding agencies

## Emergence of a vibrant ecosystem of **free software** for pure mathematics

- Specialized libraries: [LinBox](http://www.linalg.org/), [PARI/GP](http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/), [MPIR](http://mpir.org/), [Singular](http://www.singular.uni-kl.de/), ...
- General purpose systems: [GAP](http://www.gap-system.org/), [SageMath](http://www.sagemath.org/), ...
- Online databases: [OEIS](https://oeis.org/), [LMFDB](http://www.lmfdb.org/), ...
- Interactive computing environments:<br>
  [IPython/Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/), [SageMathCloud](https://cloud.sagemath.com/), ...
- Together with the wider Scientific Python ecosystem

###     

### Viable alternatives to Maple, Mathematica, Matlab, ...

For research and education. And the industry?

# What are Virtual Research Environments?

Definition from the call of the H2020 European Research
Infrastructures Work Programme:

> Groups of researchers, typically widely dispersed who are working
> together through ubiquitous, trusted and easy access to services for
> scientific data, computing, and networking, in a *collaborative
> virtual environment*

## Virtual Research Environments for mathematics?

Fact: Mathematicians are already immersed in a multitude of virtual
environments to collaborate on **Software**, **Data**, and **Knowledge**:

<!-- TODO: add screenshots from the proposal -->

# Now, what's next?

- Improve the productivity of researchers in pure mathematics and
  applications by further promoting collaborations on **Data**,
  **Knowledge**, and **Software**
- Make it easy for teams of researchers of any size to set up custom,
  collaborative **Virtual Research Environments** tailored to their
  specific needs, resources and workflows
- Support the entire life-cycle of computational work in mathematical
  research, from **initial exploration** to **publication**, **teaching**,
  and **outreach**
- Performance, robustness, flexibility, ease of install and use
- Research on social aspects of collaborative software development in
  mathematics

--
-   Join forces with the wider community (scientific computing, ...)
-   Lower the software barrier between pure and applied mathematics
