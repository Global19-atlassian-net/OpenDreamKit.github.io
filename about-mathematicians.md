# Some fundamental trends

## Long standing and booming role of computers in pure mathematics

- Computer exploration
- Conjecture verification
- Mechanized proofs
- Proof assistants and certified proofs
- Collaborative work
- Education

<!-- TODO: add examples -->

--

## Open Science getting momentum

> [Open science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science) is the
> movement to make scientific research, data and dissemination
> accessible to all levels of an inquiring society, amateur or
> professional

- Open Knowledge (Access, Educational Ressources)
- Open Source or better Free Software
- Open Data
- Open Peer Review, Methodology, ...

At the core of science for centuries. Finally getting recognition as
*viable* and *necessary*, even by funding agencies

# What are Virtual Research Environments?

Definition from the call of the H2020 European Research
Infrastructures Work Programme:

> Groups of researchers, typically widely dispersed who are working
> together through ubiquitous, trusted and easy access to services for
> scientific data, computing, and networking, in a *collaborative
> virtual environment*

## Virtual Research Environments for mathematics?

Fact: Mathematicians are already immersed in a multitude of virtual
environments to collaborate on **Software**, **Data**, and **Knowledge**:

# Now, what's next?

- Improve the productivity of researchers in pure mathematics and
  applications by further promoting collaborations on **Data**,
  **Knowledge**, and **Software**

- Make it easy for teams of researchers of any size to set up custom,
  collaborative **Virtual Research Environments** tailored to their
  specific needs, resources and workflows

- Support the entire life-cycle of computational work in mathematical
  research, from **initial exploration** to **publication**, **teaching**,
  and **outreach**

--

- Performance, robustness, flexibility, ease of installation and use

- Research on social aspects of collaborative software development in
  mathematics

## Strategy

-   Join forces with the wider community

    Scientific computing, ...

-   Lower the software barrier between pure and applied mathematics
