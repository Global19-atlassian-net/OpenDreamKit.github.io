Part of OpenDreamKit mission is to work on [user interfaces](https://github.com/OpenDreamKit//OpenDreamKit/tree/master/WP4)
for better collaboration and also [component architectures](https://github.com/OpenDreamKit//OpenDreamKit/tree/master/WP3).
This is why the [SageMathCloud](http://cloud.sagemath.com/) platform is of special
interest for us. One of our task is even to [have a deeper look into its code base](https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/issues/55).
In this post, as part of our *Review on emerging technologies*, we propose an overview
of the platform.

## What is SageMathCloud?

SageMathCloud is an online platform which allows the creation of **collaborative scientific projects**
including many scientific softwares and tools like [SageMath](http://www.sagemath.org/),
[Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/), [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/), [Julia](http://julialang.org/),
[Latex](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX), and more.

Its codebase is [open-source](https://github.com/sagemathinc/smc), distributed under the GNU General Public
License. The platform is run by a private company (SageMath Inc.) created by William Stein
who is also the initiator of the SageMath software.
