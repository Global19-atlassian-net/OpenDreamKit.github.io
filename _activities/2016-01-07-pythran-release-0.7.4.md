Pythran 0.7.4 has been released. It implements several prerequisites for Sage/Cython integration:

- less binary dependencies (dependency on ``boost-python`` and ``cmake`` removed)
- easier installation (better dependency description)
- partial Python3 port (only the cpp to native code part)
- Windows portability (based on cygwin)

And as usual, several performance improvements, more numpy API support, and
hopefully more bugs solved than the number of newly introduced ones!
