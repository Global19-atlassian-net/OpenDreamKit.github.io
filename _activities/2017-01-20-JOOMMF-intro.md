title: "A case study of computational science in Jupyter notebooks: JOOMMF"
author: Hans Fangohr and Marijan Beg
type: talk
location: "International Centre for Mathematical Sciences, Edinburgh, UK"
date: 2017/01/20

Hans Fangohr gave an introduction to computational micromagnetics and
the current workflow that is used by thousands of scientists across
the planet. He then introduced a new Python interface to the
computational tool (OOMMF), and demonstrate how this can be driven
from within a Jupyter Notebook. Through the notebook, work can be
carried out more effectively, and more reproducibly. A roadmap and
update for the Jupyter-OOMMF project was presented as well.
