title: "A case study of computational science in Jupyter notebooks: JOOMMF"
author: Hans Fangohr and Marijan Beg
type: talk
location: "International Centre for Mathematical Sciences, Edinburgh, UK"

Hans Fangohr gave an introduction to computational micromagnetics and
the current workflow that is used by thousands of scientists across
the planet. He then introduced a new Python interface to the
computational tool (OOMMF), and demonstrate how this can be driven
from within a Jupyter Notebook. Through the notebook, work can be
carried out more effectively, and more reproducibly. A roadmap and
update for the Jupyter-OOMMF project was presented as well.
