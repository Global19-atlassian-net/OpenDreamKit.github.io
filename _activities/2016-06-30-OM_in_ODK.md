The [http://opendreamkit.org](OpenDreamKit) project aims to build a virtural research environment for 
mathematics from an ecosystem of open source mathematical software systems. A crucial subgoal in this 
is to enable the systems to communicate mathematical objects, e.g. concrete elliptic curves or groups. 

The OpenDreamKit project uses the [http://openmath.org](OpenMath) format for this, as OpenMath objects are 
designed for a content-oriented representation of mathematical concepts, objects, and models. To create 
common meaning space, the OpenDreamKit project is pursuding the 
[{https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/blob/master/WP6/CICM2016/published.pdf](Math-in-the-Middle) (MitM)
paradigm to establish an ontology of mathematics that can act as a joint context for the communication. 

In the OpenMath terminology, the MitM ontology acts as a set of content dictionaries (CDs) that anchor the OpenMath 
objects semantically. For communication between the systems we only need to equip them with OpenMath phrasebooks 
(I/O libraries for OpenMath objects). The MitM ontology will be semi-automatically curated and connected to 
"system interface ontologies" (CDs for the system objects). 

The MitM Ontology can enable multiple added value services including 
* remote evaluation of mathematical expressions via 
  [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747717111002124](SCSCP)
* MONET-style service discovery via the MitM CDs. 

The current state of play is that we have initial exports of system interface ontologies for 
SageMath, GAP and (partially) and the LMFDB.
