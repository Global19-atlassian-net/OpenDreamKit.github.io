## Main goals

 NumFOCUS's Diversity \& Inclusion in Scientific Computing (``DISC'') Program strives to help create a more diverse community through initiatives and programming devoted to increasing participation by and inclusion of underrepresented people.

## OpenDreamKit implication

 OpenDreamKit Sheffield member, Tania Allard was invited to participate in this 2 day event.

## Event summary

 At the inaugural Diversity and Inclusion in Scientific Computing (DISC) Unconference in November 2017 in New York, one of the topics that came up was organizing inclusive and diverse events and conferences. How to organize such an event? Is there a checklist? Is it hard? Participants decided to build on work begun by the NumFOCUS DISC Committee creating a cookbook for organizing inclusive and diverse events, with the aim of encouraging and supporting such events.

## Results and impact
