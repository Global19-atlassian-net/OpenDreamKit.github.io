After ten months of work, the FAU group launched the [MathHub Data](https://data.mathhub.info) portal.

MathHub Data is a unified infrastructure to support deep FAIR relational mathematical data.
It builds on our MathHub system, a portal for narrative and symbolic mathematical data.
MathHub Data is a part of the MathHub portal and provides storage and hosting with integrated support for deep FAIR. 
In the future, this will also allow for the development of mathematical query languages 
(i.e., queries that abstract from the encoding) and mathematical validation 
(e.g., type-checking relative to the mathematical types, not the database types).

We have imported a few real world datasets into the system.
These include:
- [additive bases](https://data.mathhub.info/collection/ab/) 
(by [Jukka Kohonen](http://emis.ams.org/journals/JIS/VOL17/Kohonen2/kohonen5.pdf)), 
the full collection of extremal additive bases of up to 2525 elements;
- [lattices](https://data.mathhub.info/collection/lat/) 
(by [Jukka Kohonen](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11083-018-9475-2));
- [regular maniplexes](https://data.mathhub.info/collection/maniplexes/) 
(by Gabe Cunningham);
a collection of all regular maniplexes of rank 3 with automorphism groups of order 200 or less;
- [regular polyhedra](https://data.mathhub.info/collection/polyhedra/) 
(by Gabe Cunningham),
a collection of all regular abstract polyhedra with automorphism groups of order 2000 or less.

We are also preparing two larger imports to test the system.
