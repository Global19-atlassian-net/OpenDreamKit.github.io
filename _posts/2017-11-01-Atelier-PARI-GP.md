## Main goals



This was a teaching and dissemination meeting, by invitation from the math
institute in Oujda as a satellite event for their ``Journ\'ees Alg\`ebre,
  Th\'eorie des Nombres et Application''.

## OpenDreamKit implication




OpenDreamKit participants: B. Allombert and A. Page from Bordeaux.

OpenDreamKit funded travel costs for the two instructors for about 1k Euro. The
  organizing Oujda institute of mathematics co-funded the event, paying for
  all local expenses.

## Event summary




This Atelier PARI/GP took place in Oujda (Morocco) from november 22nd to
23rd, it was followed by a 2-day Moroccan national research conference on
  Algebra, Number Theory and their Applications. There were 70 participants
  from all over Morocco (no registration fees).

The 2-day Atelier featured a general introduction to PARI/GP and two
  specialized courses in the mornings (graduate level):


* Bill Allombert ``Cryptographie et courbes elliptiques'',
* Aurel Page ``Th\'eorie alg\'ebrique des nombres''.


Afternoons were devoted to practice sessions. Bill Allombert also gave
  a research talk on ``Aspects combinatoires et algorithmiques des fonctions
  $L$ d'Artin'' in the ensuing conference.

Slides for all talks are available at

## Results and impact





This was the first purely instructional PARI/GP event, it allowed us to test
the format and teaching material, thereby paving the way for future such events.
