## Main goals


In this course, we disseminated methods and solutions developed during OpenDreamKit to young researchers.
In particular, this involved the systematic modular formalization of formal languages in which mathematical knowledge is expressed.

## OpenDreamKit implication


The course was organised by Michael Kohlhase (FAU) and Florian Rabe (FAU).

## Event summary


The course consisted of 5 sessions of 90 minutes each, one each from Monday to Friday.
It was attended by undergraduate, graduate, and PhD students from mathematics, philosophy, and computer science.
Attendance was very big with 43 participants in the first sessions and 25 in the last.

## Results and impact


The main result of the workshop was the dissemination of key OpenDreamKit ideas and methods.
