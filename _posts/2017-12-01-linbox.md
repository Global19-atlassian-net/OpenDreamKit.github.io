OpenDreamKit provided the main funding source for the workshop (accommodation,
subsistence and travel expenses), for about 2.1k Euro.

## Event summary




The Camaret LinBox developer meeting took place in Grignan (France), from December
13th to 15th, 2017.

There were 9 participants from 3 different institutions (UGA, Universit√©
Montpellier 2, US Naval Academy).
No registration fees were applied.

After a round table branstorming on development projects for the meeting,
developers gathered in groups each addressing a given project.
The main achievements of the meeting include


* Progress on the distributed parallel ration solver (\delivref{hpc}{LinBox-distributed});
* Improvement on the polynomial matrix algorithmic;
* wider support of SIMD micro-architectures;
* Cleanup and simplification of the build system;
* Improvement of code robustness and release preparation (\delivref{hpc}{LinBox-algo}).




## Results and impact





The workshop was very productive and particularly beneficial to WP5
(\delivref{hpc}{LinBox-algo} and \delivref{hpc}{LinBox-distributed}).
