This is an announcement for a full-time developer ([Ingénieur de
Recherche](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ing%C3%A9nieur_de_recherche))
position opening at Université Grenoble-Alpes, working on open source
software engineering for computational mathematics.

contact: clement.pernet@imag.fr and jean-guillaume.dumas@imag.fr

# Duration

For 2 years (one year renewable) starting early 2017. Interviews will be run in December 16 and
January 17.

# Salary

Approx. 2200 € of monthly *salaire net* (salary after non-wage labour cost but before
income tax).

# Location

The developer will work at the [LJK](http://www-ljk.imag.fr) lab. on the campus of Saint-Martin d'Heres, 15 minutes
from Grenoble city center by public transportation.

# Context

Exact linear algebra, computing with arbitrary precision integer or rationals, and over finite field, is a core component of computer algebra software and also plays a central role in numerous computation intensive applications, ranging from algebraic cryptanalysis to experimental mathematics.
The [LinBox](http://github.com/linbox-team/linbox) library and its components, the [Givaro](http://github.com/linbox-team/givaro) and the [FFLAS-FFPACK](http://github.com/linbox-team/fflas-ffpack) libraries, form a C++ library ecosystem offering high performance implementation of the most common exact linear algebra routines.
These open-source libraries are integrated in the [SageMath](http://sagemath.org) open-source mathematics software.

Recently the FFLAS-FFPACK library has been parallized for multi-core architectures which opens way to two development directions:

-  propose a framework and new implementations for distributed memory architectures and accelerators such as GPU and MIC;
- make SageMath's linear algebra's routines parallel by properly exposing the new features in the interface

# Mission

The mission of the engineer will be to

- explore, experiment and develop new parallel implementations for exact linear algebra routines over distributed memory plateforms and GPU
- improve and maintain the interface between SageMath and LinBox;
- Participate actively in regular European development and training meetings with the other OpenDreamKit participants.
- maintain and improve the continuous integration system for the linbox ecosystem

# Skills and background required

- Development in Linux-like environments;

- Experience with git

- Experience with code optimisation, parallelism (OpenMP, MPI), debugging (valgrind, gdb);

- Fluency in several of C, C++, Python, Cython;

- Fluency in English;

The following are not prerequisites but would be very much appreciated:

- Experience in open-source development (collaborative development tools, interaction with the community, ...);

- Experience with computational mathematics software, in particular
  [SageMath](http://sagemath.org) or [LinBox](http://github.com/linbox-team/);

- Mathematics background.

# Applications

Applicants should send an email to clement.pernet@imag.fr and jean-guillaume.dumas@imag.fr with:

- A complete CV

- A motivation letter

Both documents must be in an open format (pdf, ps, plain text, ...) either in
french or english.

# Context

The position will be funded by

[OpenDreamKit](http://opendreamkit.org), a
[Horizon 2020](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/)
European [Research Infrastructure](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en/h2020-section/european-research-infrastructures-including-e-infrastructures)
project that will run for four years, starting from September
2015. This project brings together the open-source computational
mathematics ecosystem -- and in particular
[LinBox](http://linalg.org/),
[MPIR](http://mpir.org),
[SageMath](http://sagemath.org/),
[GAP](http://www.gap-system.org/),
[PARI/GP](http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/),
[LMFDB](http://lmfdb.org/),
[Singular](http://www.singular.uni-kl.de/),
[MathHub](https://mathhub.info/),
and the
[IPython/Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) interactive computing
environment.
-- toward building a
flexible toolkit for
[Virtual Research Environments](http://www.2020-horizon.com/e-Infrastructures-for-virtual-research-environments-%28VRE%29-i1490.html)
for mathematics. Led by Université Paris-Sud, this project involves
about 50 people spread over 15 sites in Europe, with a total budget of
about 7.6 million euros.

The developer will work within a team of developpers of SageMath and LinBox, and researchers in the field of high performance computer algebra
at the [Laboratoire Jean Kuntzmann](http://www-ljk.imag.fr/).
