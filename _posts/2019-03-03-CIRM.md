## Main goals

 This was a research conference on the cohomology of
arithmetic groups, with a focus on computational techniques.

## OpenDreamKit implication

 Bill Allombert was invited to give a 1-hour
introduction to PARI/GP for a software session during the conference.
He gave a tutorial on the manipulation of lattices, $L$-functions,
modular forms and curves of small genus in the system.

OpenDreamKit participants: B. Allombert from Bordeaux.

OpenDreamKit funded the participation of B. Allombert to the event (about 600 Euro).

## Event summary

 This conference took place in Luminy (France)
from March 24th to 29th, with the participation of about 70 mathematicians.

Slides for the PARI/GP presentation are available at
http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/Events/CIRM2019/

## Results and impact

 This was a successful teaching and dissemination
event towards a community (arithmetic geometry, representation theory)
for which computer-aided calculations is less natural than in other
areas of mathematics: the talk was well-received with interesting
feedback.
