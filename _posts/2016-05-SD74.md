## Main goals

 This workshop was dedicated to the implementation of some
topology and differential geometry in SageMath, partly in connection with the
SageManifolds project http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/. 3D visualisation
in the Jupyter notebook was also discussed.

## OpenDreamKit implication

 OpenDreamKit, via its Orsay and Bordeaux nodes, supported the travel and living expenses of 7 speakers:


* Marck Bell (U. Illinois, Urbana-Champaign)
* Marck Culler (U. Illinois, Chicago)
* Nathan Dunfield (U. Illinois, Urbana-Champaign)
* Patrick Hooper (City College of New York)
* Vincent Delecroix (U. Bordeaux)
* Jeremy L. Martin (U. Kansas, Lawrence)
* John Palmieri (U. Washington, Seattle)



## Event summary

 Morning sessions were devoted to talks on various
topics relevant to the workshop theme, some of them involving codes that are
not part of SageMath (SnapPy, Flipper, Gyoto).
Afternoon sessions were devoted to working groups and coding sprints.

## Demographic


26 persons took part in these Sage Days: 5 females and 21 males, originating
from the following countries: France (11), USA (8), Poland (3), Germany (2), Russia (1) and UK (1).


## Results and impact


41 SageMath tickets have been written or reviewed during the workshop; the list
of them is available at https://trac.sagemath.org/query?keywords=~sd74&or&keywords=~days74
Progresses on the K3D-jupyter visualisation are reported at
