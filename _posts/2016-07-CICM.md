## Main goals

 Since a decade, CICM collocates several workshops: Calculemus
(automated reasoning systems and Computer algebra), DML (Digital Math
Library), MKM (Mathematical Knowledge Management), AISC (Artificial
Intelligence and Symbolic Computation) with the deliberate strategy to
bring together a diverse crowd of people. In particular, the Tetrapod
workshop is meant to exchange ideas between people involved in the
four main areas of *mechanized mathematics*: computation, data,
knowledge management, and deduction (proof systems).

## OpenDreamKit implication

 Five OpenDreamKit participants attended the conference, Michael Kohlhase
from JU as General chair together with Florian Rabe, Tom Wiesing, and Dennis Müller
from his group, and Nicolas Thiéry from PS as invited
speaker~\cite{Thierry:igcscac16}. They delivered several talks, including about the WP6
paper~\cite{DehKohKon:iop16}, and an MMT tutorial~\cite{RabIanMue:ldm16,RabIanMue:adm16}.

## Results and impact

 CICM was a prime occasion to advertise and brainstorm with
the larger community about the WP6 advances, and get very interesting feedback. For
details, see the blog post at~\cite{Thiery:pdc16}.
