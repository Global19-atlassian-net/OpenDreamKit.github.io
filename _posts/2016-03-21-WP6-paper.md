We have just submitted a paper to the
[Projects&Surveys track of CICM 2016](http://www.cicm-conference.org/2016/cicm.php?event=surveys&menu=general). [The
paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06424)
([bibTeX](https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/blob/master/publications.bib)) presents the ODK project to the CICM community and then presents the
"Math-in-the-Middle" approach to interoperability we have developed in the
[St. Andrews WP6 workshop](http://opendreamkit.org/2015/12/08/WP6StAndrewsMeeting/).
