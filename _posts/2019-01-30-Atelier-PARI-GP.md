## Results and impact

 The workshop was productive and a successful
teaching and dissemination event; 12 participants came from developping
countries (Algeria, Djibouti, Lebanon, Morroco, Senegal, Tunisia,
Turkey).

It provided final feedback on recent PARI/GP developments that paved the way
for the release of \texttt{pari-2.12-alpha} (2019/06).
