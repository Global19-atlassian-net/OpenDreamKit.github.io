## Main goals

 Work meeting to understand the type systems of GAP and
Sage, and to develop a first interface between MMT, GAPs!, and Sage.

## OpenDreamKit implication

 OpenDreamKit through Jacobs Uni Bremen was the main
organizer of this event to work on WP6. PS participated remotely.

## Event summary

 The event featured a talk about the GAP type
system, and many discussions between the researchers in Bremen and
Markus Pfeiffer. We developed a substantial piece of software to
enable GAP to interface with MMT. Meanwhile PS, with the
support of SA and JU, made further progress on
\delivref{component-architecture}{semantic-interface-sage-gap} and on
the export of the math knowledge embedded in Sage.

## Results and impact

  This workshop was essential to OpenDreamKit WP6,
in particular for \longtaskref{dksbases}{data-design} and
\delivref{dksbases}{design}.
