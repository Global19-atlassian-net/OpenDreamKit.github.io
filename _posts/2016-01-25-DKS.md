  ## Main goals

 Semiannual OpenDreamKit project meeting joined with a WP6
  ``Data/Knowledge/Software bases'' kickoff workshop dedicated to the exploration of how
  mathematical knowledge could be better represented and exploited within systems and for
  communicating between systems.

  ## OpenDreamKit implication

 St Andrews hosted this event which was organized by Paris Sud
  (project meeting) and Jacobs Uni (WP6 workshop).

  ## Event summary

  Tuesday morning was dedicated to OpenDreamKit's semiannual [steering committee
  meeting](http://opendreamkit.org/meetings/2016-01-25-DKS/SteeringCommittee/minutes/),
  including progress reports from all sites. A couple additional OpenDreamKit participants
  joined physically or remotely for this meeting.

  The rest of the week was dedicated to Work Package 6 activities. To bootstrap the
  discussions, we started with a presentation by Michael Kohlhase of his ideas for a
  Knowledge First strategy\footnote{This eventually became the ``Math-in-the-Middle''
    paradigm~\cite{DehKohKon:iop16}}, followed by presentations of how knowledge is
  represented in various components of OpenDreamKit (FindStat: Viviane Pons, LMFDB: Paul-Olivier
  Dehaye, GAP: Markus Pfeiffer, SageMath: Nicolas M. Thiéry), in preparation for
  \longdelivref{dksbases}{design}. There was also a brief presentation of a
  proof-of-concept Knowledge-aware Sage-GAP interface developed the week before at the
  GAP/Sage Days. Current practices where discussed as well: commonalities in ``dumping
  math data on the web'' process (FindStat, LMFDB,…). Then came a tutorial presentation of
  MMT to explore how knowledge representation in MMT could serve as a generic knowledge
  backbone for integrating the various systems.  After these warm up activities, we moved
  on to brainstorms and joint code sprints, developing proof-of-concepts formalizations of
  the knowledge in the various components and exploring applications: detecting bugs and
  inconsistencies in code and data, generating more complete documentation, supporting
  generic handle interfaces, ...

A fine grained report of the activities is available
[here](http://opendreamkit.org/meetings/2016-01-25-DKS/report/).

## Results and impact

 The Math-in-the-Middle approach was born
at this workshop. This led to a joint paper at the CICM
conference~\cite{DehKohKon:iop16} and kicked off and fueled much of
the activity on WP6 since then, in particular around
\longtaskref{dksbases}{data-design}, \delivref{dksbases}{design},
\delivref{dksbases}{dkstheories}, and
\delivref{component-architecture}{semantic-interface-sage-gap}.
