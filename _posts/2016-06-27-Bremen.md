  ## Main goals

 Annual project meeting, interim review and workshops

  ## OpenDreamKit implication

 JacobsUni (Bremen) hosted this event which
  was coorganized by Paris Sud and fully funded by OpenDreamKit.

  ## Event summary

 The beginning of the week was dedicated to
  OpenDreamKitâ€™s open and internal meetings, including an interim review with
  our Project Officer and three EU Commission reviewers. The rest of
  the week was dedicated to joint work sessions on WP4 (User
  Interfaces) and WP6 (Data/Knowledge/Software bases, aka
  Math-in-the-middle) activities.

  ## Demographic

 21 OpenDreamKit participants together with OpenDreamKit's
  project officer and three reviewers from the EU Commission.

  ## Results and impact

 This meeting was the occasion to build
  a common overview of what was achieved during the first ten months,
  and plan together work on the upcoming tasks and deliverables. The
  project review was enormously helpful to get early feedback
  and start preparing for the upcoming review at Month 18
  (March 2017).
