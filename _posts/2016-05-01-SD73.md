## Main goals


This Sage workshop was a satellite of the conference Flat Surfaces and
Dynamics of Moduli Space that happened in Oaxaca May 08-13. The aim was to
introduce participants to SageMath and share code and knowledge.

On the first day, we also had two participants from the University of 
Oaxaca.

## OpenDreamKit implication

 OpenDreamKit, via its Bordeaux node, supported the expenses
of participants. Vincent Delecroix made introductory and advanced talks about
SageMath and Python.
  
## Event summary

 The first day was dedicated to a SageMath introduction.
Each day in the afternoon, we had a demonstration from a participant. The rest
of the time was dedicated to programming.

## Demographic


11 persons took part in these Sage Days: 2 females and 9 males, originating
from the following countries: Mexico (3), Canada (3), France (3), USA (2)

## Results and impact




* A step toward the convergence of the IPython and SageMath notebooks with https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20562} (\delivref{UI}{ipython-kernel-sage)
* A fix in SageMath for a problem discovered Maxime Fortier-Bourque during the workshop (https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20566)
* Charles Fougeron's code about Lyapunov exponents gets integrated in https://github.com/videlec/sage-flatsurf.
* New visualization tools for geometry of translation surfaces at https://github.com/videlec/flatsurf-package.
* And several experimentations by the other participants.
