  ## Main goals

 This event was organized as a satellite of a
  Jupyter dissemination conference at École Polytechnique. It brought
  together developers of the Virtual Environments JupyterHub and
  BinderHub and DevOps working on deployments in Orsay and at EGI for
  a coding sprint. The goal was to improve those deployments, as a use
  case from which to learn and share procedures and best practices.

  ## OpenDreamKit implication

 Organization and funding of OpenDreamKit participants; $\approx$ 1k Euro.

  ## Results and impact

 Turnkey deployment instructions already
  existed for deploying JupyterHub and BinderHub on top of cloud
  infrastructure provided by e.g. Google Cloud, or Microsoft Azure.
  This workshop was a major step for the first deployment of a
  JupyterHub and BinderHub instance on top of an OpenStack cloud
  infrastructure. This is important as OpenStack is widely adopted in
  academia-run cloud infrastructures, yet raises some unique
  challenges due to its high customizability. Many notes were taken
  and shared. In addition a blog post summarized a brainstorm on the
  upcoming convergence between JupyterHub and BindherHub, toward
  providing versatile JupyterHub deployments that lets its user
  define, run, and share virtual environments equipped with an
  arbitrary software stack.
