## Main goals


The main goal of the Sage Days 84 were to
gather researcher specialists in polyhedral computations and advanced
SageMath developers.

## OpenDreamKit implication




OpenDreamKit organizer: V. Delecroix.

OpenDreamKit participants: V. Klein

OpenDreamKit provided the funding source for the workshop (accommodation,
subsistence and travel expenses) for about 20k Euro.

## Event summary




The Sage Days 84 took place in Olot (Spain) from february 2nd to
march 10th. It was focused on polyhedral computations.

There were 12 registered participants. A typical day of the workshop
consisted in talks and hacking session.

## Results and impact




This was a development workshop dedicated to researcher polyhedral
computations. We obtain interesting feedback especialy from
the polymake developers Julian Pfeifle and Andreas Paffenholz. One
of the achievement was the integration in SageMath of an interface
to polymake
(see https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22452).
