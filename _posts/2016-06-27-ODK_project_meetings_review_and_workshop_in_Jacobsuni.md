The beginning of the week will be dedicated to ODK open and closed meetings (including the review with the Commission reviewers), and the end of the week will be dedicated to joint work sessions devoted to WP6 activities (priority is given to WP6 but other workgroups can join in!).

-	Wednesday: more talks with the reviewers if necessary/possible + free time for all ODK participants to work together 
-	Thursday & Friday : workgroup sessions (especially on WP6)
