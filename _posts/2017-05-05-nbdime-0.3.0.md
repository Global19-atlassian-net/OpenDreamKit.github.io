We are happy to announce release 0.3.0 of [nbdime](https://nbdime.readthedocs.io),
continuing to improve the process of working with Jupyter notebooks in version control.

The highlight of 0.3 is much improved integration with git, making it easier than ever
to get started with nbdime in git:

    pip install --upgrade nbdime # install nbdime
    nbdime config-git --global --enable # tell git to use nbdime when it sees notebooks

and you can get nice GUI diffs directly from git refs on the command-line:

    nbdiff-web master mynotebook.ipynb
