## Main goals

 The French Ministry for Research as recently
spawned a new committee to foster and coordinate Open Science take up
in France. One of its four work groups is on Free and Open Source
Software, led by Roberto Dicosmo, long time Open Source advocate and
initiator of the Software Heritage project.

## OpenDreamKit implication

 Nicolas M. Thi√©ry, OpenDreamKit coordinator, was
invited to join the work group.

## Results and impact

 This work group will give long time Open
Source and Open Science advocates leverage to disseminate best
practices and supporting technologies far beyond their original
communities.
