This was a teaching and dissemination meeting, by invitation from the Roman
  Number Theory Association as a satellite event for their 4th
  mini-symposium.

The 2-day Atelier followed the same pattern as the preceding Oujda Atelier,
featuring a general introduction to PARI/GP and two
  specialized courses (graduate level) in the mornings:


* Bill Allombert ``Elliptic curves over finite fields and number fields'',
* Aurel Page ``Algebraic number theory''.


Afternoons were devoted to practice sessions.

Slides for all talks are available at
