WP6 participants JacU (Florian Rabe), FAU (Dennis MÃ¼ller, Michael Kohlhase) and UZH (Paul
Olivier Dehaye) came together with members of the
[Weierstrass Institute for Applied Analysis and Stochastics](http://wias-berlin.de/)
(WIAS: Thomas Koprucki and Carsten Tabelow) for a code sprint on the Math-in-the-Middle
Content and Logic and the encoding of mathematical Models. The result of this was a
significant extension of the MitM ontology (in particular for the meta-theories for Sage)
and a
[WIAS preprint on formalizations of Models](http://dx.doi.org/10.20347/WIAS.PREPRINT.2385).
