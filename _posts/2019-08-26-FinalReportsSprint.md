This workshop will bring together OpenDreamKit participants just
before the end of the project to collectively:

- Finish up writing our final reports
- Prepare demos for the final review
- Any other collaborative ODK work

And last but not least:

- Celebrate the last week of our joint ODK adventure!

All ODK participants (or close collaborators) are welcome. Funding is
as usual: Paris-Sud will pay for local expenses (food + lodging);
sites pay for the travel expenses of their members.

Like our usual Cernay workshop, this will be rather informal: we will
cook for each other, share rooms, etc. See the notes on the [local
organization](https://hackmd.io/4b8zBeKLS6i9w84G0ChanA).

comment on the poll if you care about having a single room. When you
know them, please also specify your arrival and departure time on the
