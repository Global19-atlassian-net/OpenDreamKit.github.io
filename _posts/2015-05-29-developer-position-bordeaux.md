---

# Salary

Depending on the applicant's past experience, between 1600 € and 2300
€ of *salaire net* (salary after non wage labour cost but before
income tax) monthly. Equivalently, this is a *salaire brut* between
23600 € and 34999 € yearly.

# Location

The developer will work at the
[LaBRI](http://labri.fr) in the Talence campus at 10 minutes
from Bordeaux center by public transport.

# Mission

To support the maintenance and development of the OpenDreamKit
components, and in particular of the [SageMath](http://sagemath.org) and
[PARI/GP](http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/) projects.

# Activities

According to his or her specific skills, the developer will take on, in close
collaboration with the community, a selection of the software engineering tasks
defined in the OpenDreamKit project. Those tasks concern:

- Improvements of the existing software components (code optimisation,
  parallelisation, ...);

- Better communication between the software components;

- Improvements of the graphic interfaces;

- Active participation to regular european development and training meetings
  with the other OpenDreamKit participants.

# Skills and background required

- Development in Unix-like environments;

- Experience in open-source development (collaborative
  development tools, interaction with the community, ...);

- Fluency in one or several of C, C++, Python, Cython, assemblers;

- Fluency in English;

The following are not prerequesites but would be very much appreciated:

- Experience with code optimization, parallelism, etc; 

- Experience with computational mathematics software, in particular
  [SageMath](http://sagemath.org) or [PARI/GP](http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/);

- Mathematics background;

# Context

The position will be funded by

[OpenDreamKit](http://opendreamkit.org), a
[Horizon 2020](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/)
European [Research Infrastructure](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en/h2020-section/european-research-infrastructures-including-e-infrastructures)
project that will run for four years, starting from September
2015. This project brings together the open source computational
mathematics ecosystem -- and in particular
[LinBox](http://linalg.org/),
[MPIR](http://mpir.org),
[SageMath](http://sagemath.org/),
[GAP](http://www.gap-system.org/),
[Pari/GP](http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/),
[LMFDB](http://lmfdb.org/),
[Singular](http://www.singular.uni-kl.de/),
[MathHub](https://mathhub.info/),
and the
[IPython/Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) interactive computing
environment.
-- toward building a
flexible toolkit for
[Virtual Research Environments](http://www.2020-horizon.com/e-Infrastructures-for-virtual-research-environments-%28VRE%29-i1490.html)
for mathematics. Lead by Université Paris Sud this project involves
about 50 people spread over 15 sites in Europe, with a total budget of
about 7.6 million euros.

The developer will work within one of the largest teams of SageMath
developers, composed essentially of researchers in mathematics and
computer science, at the [Laboratoire Bordelais de Recherche en
Informatique](http://www.labri.fr/) and in nearby institutions.


# Comments

:warning: This is *not* a postdoc position. While side research will
be welcome, and a few tasks may possibly lead to some research
problems in computer science, the core tasks will be pure
development. Candidates wishing to pursue an academic research career
in the long run should consider twice whether this opportunity is
adequate for them.
