On April 26th, OpenDreamKit underwent its first formal review by the
European Commission. We presented the achievements of the first 18
months of the project, including
[30 deliverables](https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/issues?q=label%3AReportingPeriod1)
([reports](/events_activities/reports/), [slides](meetings/2017-04-26-ProjectReviewPresentations/)).
Overall, **the feedback was very positive**, with language such as
"enthusiasts", "brilliant", "amazing job", or "things have come along
fantastically". We made a strong point in our reports and
presentations that a vast majority of what's happening comes from the
ecosystem we support. All we do is exploit the special resources the
EU is entrusting us to knock down some tough hurdles that are
preventing the ball to roll. **Kudos to our communities!**

## Debriefing notes I sent to the OpenDreamKit participants

About twenty of us were in Brussels early this week for the
OpenDreamKit Month 18 formal review. After two days of intensive
preparation, we presented our work on Wednesday to our project officer
and reviewers.

There are a few points that we need to think about (not unexpected).
But otherwise the hard work we all put since the beginning of the
project came out as quite a show. The panel gave very constructive
feedback and were overall really happy. They appreciate our approach,
our work, our spirit.

Now is the time to enjoy that appreciation and build on that energy to
do even better in the coming years. Pass this on to our communities!

Speaking of funding: the reviewers made a strong point that we bear a
big responsibility: apparently mathematics does not have a good press
in the high spheres these days. We were *very lucky*, as a math
project, to be funded; it's really because they appreciated so much
the strength of the proposal and our "clever and creative
interpretation of the call" that we made it through. "No other math
project is being funded" (this quote obviously does not apply to
ERC's; the scope is plausibly that of H2020 projects).

They now need strong ammunition to make sure that future calls leave
room for mathematics. So not only do we have to succeed because we
care so much about our aims (and should investigate followups to
pursue them further), but also for the sake of other projects
elsewhere in mathematics. We also need to proactively explain and
highlight to a wider audience what we do in collaboration with our
communities. There is very good stuff going on, let it be seen.

Some further thoughts needs to be put in how to achieve that. For now,
the take home message is simple: ***If you witness something nice
happening, from a technical achievement with a wow factor to a thought
provoking anecdote, write a blog post about it***. See the
[instructions](https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit.github.io/blob/master/_posts/README.md),
or even just send a brief draft text by e-mail to
[Mike Croucher](mailto:m.croucher@sheffield.ac.uk) with
[me](mailto:Nicolas.Thiery@u-psud.fr) in CC.

Let me conclude by thanking the whole band that came to Brussels (with
a special nod to the presenters on which we dumped the most delicate
presentations). I was frustrated as you all were spending all this
time together without tackling what we all really care most. However
we built on our image in the commission, and used the occasion to
strengthen our group around a joint vision. This is a worthwhile long
term investment.

Thank you everybody for all the enthusiastic, dedicated and beautiful
work. It's an honor and a pleasure to be working with such a team.

Remember: pass it on to those supporting you and to your communities.

Cheers,
		Nicolas
