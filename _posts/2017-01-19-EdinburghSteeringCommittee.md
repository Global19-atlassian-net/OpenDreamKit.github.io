The biannual OpenDreamKit Steering Committee meeting is taking place in Edinburgh in order to organise it along with the [Computational Mathematics with Jupyter](http://opendreamkit.org/meetings/2017-01-16-ICMS/) workshop. Its main objective is to finalise all deliverables due for Month 18, aka February 2017, (end of the hard deadline known as the 1st Reporting Period). 

This means that all deliverables due by this date will have to be finished for mid-February so that they can be looked over.
