  ## Main goals

 This training workshop was organized at the
  occasion of a four month CRM thematic semester
  [Algebra and words in combinatorics(http://www.crm.umontreal.ca/Combinatorics2017/index.php/)
  at the [Laboratoire de combinatoire et d'informatique mathématique (LaCIM)](http://lacim.uqam.ca/en/) of
  [Université du Québec à Montréal](http://www.uqam.ca/).

  Taking advantage of the participation of Nicolas M. Thiéry to the thematic semester (as
  member of the scientific committee), this workshop was followed by a [weekly half-day
  meeting](https://wiki.sagemath.org/Montreal) around computational tools for
  combinatorics until July 2017, and [computational
  sessions](https://more-sagemath-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/2017-05-29-CRM/) at
  the occasion of certain spring schools of the semester.

  ## OpenDreamKit implication

 The Sage Days was organized by Nicolas M.
  Thiéry (OpenDreamKit coordinator, Paris Sud) and Sébastien Labbé (since then
  OpenDreamKit participant at CNRS). OpenDreamKit funded some of the invited speakers
  and OpenDreamKit participants. Later events were organized by Nicolas (no
  funding needed).

  ## Event summary

 An intensive week with many brainstorms and
  coding sprints + follow up meetings.

  ## Demographic

 31 participants (including 2 from OpenDreamKit), about
  half of which being female.

  ## Results and impact

 Beside training many new Sage users
  and developers, the workshop and followup events boosted an active
  local user group at LaCIM, including a new generation of graduate
  students and postdocs, but also François Bergeron, a prominent
  figure in experimental combinatorics who used the occasion to switch
  to Sage. Discussions prompted the organization by this group of
  Sage Days 95, a one week Women in Sage workshop in July 2018,
  where OpenDreamKit member (Sheffield) and Research Software Engineer Tania
  Allard was invited as role model.

  Altogether
 [18 Sage tickets]({https://trac.sagemath.org/query?status=closed&status=needs_info&status=needs_review&status=needs_work&status=new&status=positive_review&keywords=~days86&col=id&col=summary&col=status&col=time&col=changetime&col=author&col=reviewer&order=status}) were actively worked on during the week.
