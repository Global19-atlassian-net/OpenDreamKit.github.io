OpenDreamKit WP6 (Data/Knowledge/Software-Bases) has reported on the first use cases in
two papers to be publised at [MACIS 2017](https://macis2017.sba-research.org/).
 * [Knowledge-Based Interoperability for Mathematical Software Systems](https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/blob/master/WP6/MACIS17-interop/crc.pdf) (Michael Kohlhase, Luca Defeo, Dennis MÃ¼ller, Markus Pfeiffer, Florian Rabe, Nicolas Thiery, Victor Vasilyxev, and Tom Wiesing) develops the Math-in-the-Middle Ontology for computational group theory and shows a three-system use case (Sage, GAP, Singular). 
 * [Virtual Theories - A Uniform Interface to Mathematical Knowledge Bases](https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/blob/master/WP6/MACIS17-vt/crc.pdf) (Tom Wiesing, Michael Kohlhase, and Florian Rabe) extends the MMT theories to "Virtual theories", which do not have the "load-into-memory-fully" restrictions of "concrete theories" and are therefore suited for very large data sources like the [LMFDB](http://lmfdb.org) or [OEIS](http:/oeis.org).
