This community building and training conference aims to bring
together users and developers of (open source) (pure) mathematics
software, including GAP, Linbox, MPIR, Pari/GP, SageMath, or Singular.
Following a long trend of highly productive workshops within the various communities (e.g. the Sage-Days series), this   conference will consist of keynote talks and hands on tutorials with a focus on experimental research and computational and development best practices; and plenty of free time for interactions and collaborative work.

This conference is organized by the H2020 European project [OpenDreamKit](http://opendreamkit.org), of which
it will be the main public closing event.
