## Main goals

 In two sessions during the conference, users had a chance to talk to us, give us feedback, and request features.

## OpenDreamKit implication

 JOOMMF was developed as a part of the OpenDreamKit project and one participant from the OpenDreamKit was present to deliver the workshop (Marijan Beg). The workshop was fully funded by the OpenDreamKit and total costs were 2048.67 euros.

## Event summary

 In two drop-in sessions, we helped users with installation, looked at their simulation requirements, and received some feedback and feature requests.

## Results and impact

 During the workshop we received the feedback from the participants about our Python interface to OOMMF.
