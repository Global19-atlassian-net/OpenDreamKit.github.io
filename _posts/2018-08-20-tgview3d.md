The Math-in-the-Middle (MitM) ontology and the system API theories in the MitM paradigm
are big theory graphs with thousands of nodes and edges. Understanding and interacting
with such large and complex objects is very difficult for humans.

The FAU group has conducted research into whether virtual reality technologies are helpful
for this task. We have presented a first working prototype at the
[Conference on Intelligent Computer Mathematics CICM 2018](https://cicm-conference.org/2018/)
and the author: Richard Marcus - a master's student at FAU has received a prize for best
presentation.
