On October 30th of 2019, the OpenDreamKit will undergo its final formal review by
the European Commission, represented by three reviewers and our former
and new project officers.
About twenty five of us come to Luxembourg to
present our achievements during the third period of the project
(September 2018 to August 2019) as well as the project as a whole,
including [13 deliverables](https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+label%3Adeliverable+label%3AReportingPeriod3+).
See our [reports](/project/reports/#reporting-period-3).

After
[two days of rehearsals](https://opendreamkit.org/meetings/2019-10-30-Luxembourg/),
we have one day of
[presentations and software demonstrations](https://opendreamkit.org/meetings/2018-10-30-Luxembourg/ProjectReview/).
