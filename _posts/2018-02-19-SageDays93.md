## Main goals


The main goal of the Sage Days 93 were to
gather researcher specialists in Lie groups and advanced
SageMath and PARI/GP developers. The two goals were to implement
more Lie group theory in the softwares and conversely produce
experimental results for researchers.


## OpenDreamKit implication




OpenDreamKit organizer: V. Delecroix.

OpenDreamKit provided the funding source for the workshop (accommodation,
subsistence and travel expenses) for about 20k Euro.

## Event summary




The Sage Days 93 took place in Olot (Spain) from february 19th to

consisted in talks and hacking session.

## Results and impact




This was a development workshop dedicated to researcher in Lie groups
and their lattices. We obtain interesting feedback and developed
