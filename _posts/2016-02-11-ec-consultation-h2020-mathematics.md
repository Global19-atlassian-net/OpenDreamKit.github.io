The European Commission has just launched an
[open consultation on “mathematics in H2020”](https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/content/online-consultation-mathematics-excellence-science-horizon2020).

``The objective is to collect a large quantity of concrete proposals
that can subsequently be used to inform and elaborate calls (in the
FET framework, for 2018-19-20) with explicit mathematical sciences
content. We urge you to contribute massively to this consultation
(deadline March 30th): We are of the opinion that mathematics should
not be reserved to ERC, but should be omnipresent in the future work
programmes!''
