The FAU group completed the tutorial **[OMDoc/MMT for Mathematicians](https://gl.mathhub.info/Tutorials/Mathematicians/blob/master/tutorial/mmt-math-tutorial.pdf)** on working with MMT content targeted at Mathematicians. It covers creating new [archives](http://uniformal.github.io/doc/applications/archives.html), the [MMT language](http://uniformal.github.io/doc/language/), using LF, working with [jEdit](http://uniformal.github.io/doc/applications/jedit.html), [building](http://uniformal.github.io/doc/applications/building.html) archives, browsing the MMT [server](http://uniformal.github.io/doc/applications/server.html).

This is a good way to get into formalizing mathematics in the Math-in-the-Middle ontology which is central to WP6 in OpenDreamKit.
