## Main goals

 Gather developers from Sage, SageMathCloud and Jupyter together to learn the
inner machineries of the different projects and code together towards common goals.

## OpenDreamKit implication

 This event was coorganized by OpenDreamKit which
cofunded the participation of two OpenDreamKit members and another European
associate.

## Event summary

 The event featured many interesting talks on the inner mechanics of
both SageMathCloud and Jupyter, in particular:


* [How to contribute to SageMathCloud](https://youtu.be/GOuy07Kift4) by William Stein
* **The PARI Jupyter kernel** by Jeroen Demeyer
* **Jupyter Notebook development** by Jason Grout.


Lots of time was devoted to projects and code such as: installing a development version of SageMathCloud,
following tutorials on SageMathCloud development, working toward the integration of the Jupyter notebook
in Sage.

Furthermore a Jupyter interface for HPC-GAP was developed, and the Jupyter
interface for GAP was improved. A talk **The current status of (HPC-)GAP**
was contributed.

## Results and impact

 
This workshop was essential to some OpenDreamKit planned tasks. This was especially related to WP3 and WP4. Here are some tasks that
were started during the Sage Days:


* \longtaskref{component-architecture}{extract-smc} Document and modularize SageMathCloud's codebase. This task was started during the workshop using the 
knowledge of the main developer of SageMathClod, William Stein.

* \longtaskref{UI}{ipython-kernels} Uniform notebook interface for all interactive components. This is a major task of WP4. This workshop
was an occasion to share first hand information between Sage, GAP, and Jupyter developers.



The knowledge we gathered during presentations was relevant to all tasks including notebook interfaces and cloud
systems.
