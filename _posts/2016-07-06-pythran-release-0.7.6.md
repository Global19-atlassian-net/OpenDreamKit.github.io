Pythran 0.7.6 has been released. It's a big step forward better handling of complex scientific code:

- type engine improvement
- improved value binding analysis
- constant global variable support

Additionally, some notable improvements can benefit to the scientific community:

- better Jupyter notebook integration
- restored and tested OpenMP support
- broader support of Numpy broadcasting


And as usual, several performance improvements, more Numpy API support, and
hopefully more bugs solved than the number of newly introduced ones!
