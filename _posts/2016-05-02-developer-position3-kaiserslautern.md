title: Full-time developer position at TU Kaiserslautern for six months beginning August 2016
---

We are seeking a full-time developer at TU Kaiserslautern to work with Dr. William Hart on the MPIR [http://mpir.org/](http://mpir.org/) bignum library.

# Location

The developer will work at TU Kaiserslautern in the city of Kaiserslautern Germany. Kaiserslautern is next to one of the largest contiguous forests in Europe.

# Mission

To help maintain the MPIR library as part of the OpenDreamKit collaboration, in particular to enhance the performance and portability of the library.

# Activities

The successful applicant will help support recent Intel and AMD processors in MPIR by usng an existing superoptimiser on assembly language routines in MPIR to speed them up.

The applicant will also help parallelise the large integer multiplication routine in MPIR by parallelising the existing FFT code (written in C) to speed up multiplication of very large integers.

There is also an oppotunity to help add the double and triple large prime variants to our existing quadratic sieve, for factoring large integers.

# Skills requirements

- x86_64 assembly language experience or a strong willingness to learn

- Experience in low-level optimisation

- Fluency in English

- Must have a Masters degree in Mathematics, Computer Science, Computer Engineering or equivalent.

- Experience in Open Source development and tooling
