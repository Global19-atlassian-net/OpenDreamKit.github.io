  ## Main goals

 This developer meeting was focused on
  initiating long term work on OpenDreamKit tasks related to packaging,
  portability and documentation tools for GAP and SageMath.

  ## OpenDreamKit implication

 This event was organized and funded by
  OpenDreamKit (Paris Sud).

  ## Event summary

 An intensive week with many brainstorms and coding sprints.

  ## Demographic

 9 OpenDreamKit members from five sites together with
  half a dozen other participants

  ## Results and impact

 Proper packaging and distribution has
  been a recurrent issue for large computational software like Sage
  or GAP, and is a major task for OpenDreamKit
  (\longtaskref{component-architecture}{mod-packaging}). This workshop
  was a follow up to the highly successful Sage Days 77 organized in
  2016 by OpenDreamKit where long term plans were designed. Here the workshop
  focused on accelerating the implementation of the plans, with highly
  productive collaborative coding sprints on topics such as GAP and
  Sage packaging (Conda, ...), Sage portability (Windows) and
  documentation, GAP's build system and release management, and how
  to best integrate GAP and Sage together via a shared library.
