# Comments

:warning: This is *not* a postdoc position. While side research will
be welcome, and a few tasks may possibly lead to some research
problems in computer science, the core tasks will be pure development
(e.g. improvements to build, documentation, packaging, and
distribution systems, design and implementation of component
architecture). People wishing to pursue an academic research career
should consider twice whether this opportunity is appropriate for them.
