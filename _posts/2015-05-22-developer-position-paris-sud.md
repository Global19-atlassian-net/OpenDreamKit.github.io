# Comments

:warning: This is *not* a postdoc position. While side research will
be welcome, and a few tasks may possibly lead to some research
problems in computer science, the core tasks will be pure development
(e.g. improvements to build, packaging, and documentation systems). We
thus do not recommend this position to people who would like to pursue
an academic research career.
