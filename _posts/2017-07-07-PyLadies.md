## Main goals

 The PyLadies organization is an international mentorship group with a focus on helping more women become active participants and leaders in the Python open-source community. PyLadies Paris is the local Paris chapter.

## OpenDreamKit implication

 Viviane Pons from OpenDreamKit has been the co-organizer of the PyLadies Paris events for the last two years. The Meetup group has 494 members and has had 57 events.

## Event summary

 Meetup include networking events for women coders such as ``Talking Bar'' and ``Coding Caf√©''. They usually gather between 3 and 10 participants. Some events include presentations and / or tutorials on some specific subjects.

## Demographic

 These events are open to women who are interested in python. This include professional python developers, academics, scientist, students, and enthusiast learners.

## Results and impact

 We believe such events are very important to support women coders. They allow to build a strong professional network. It is also an occasion to discuss python practices and, in particlar, OpenDreamKit developments in an informal and relaxed atmosphere.
