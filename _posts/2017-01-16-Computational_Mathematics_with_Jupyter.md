Jointly with the Collaborative Computational Project ["CoDiMa - CCP 
in the area of Computational Discrete Mathematics"](http://www.codima.ac.uk/),
we are currently organising a workshop 
["Computational Mathematics with Jupyter"](http://opendreamkit.org/meetings/2017-01-16-ICMS/).

It will take place at the [International Centre for Mathematical Sciences](http://www.icms.org.uk/) 
in Edinburgh on 16-20 January 2017. Please see the [workshop website](http://opendreamkit.org/meetings/2017-01-16-ICMS/) for further details.

The [Software Sustainability Institute blog](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2017-02-02-computational-mathematics-jupyter)
is hosting a summary of the event.
