## Introduction

The ease of authoring manuscripts is a key to wide application of any
new techcology in educational practice. Generally speaking, academic
teachers lecturing on computer science tend to be fluent in all kinds
of computer technology and happily adopt new ones. However, as topics
get further and further from computer science as in theoretical
mechanics or dynamical systems technology, technology literacy becomes
a barrier. It can often happen that such subjects are not integrated
with computer technologies during teaching at all.

## Scenario

John is lecturing teoretical mechanics and wants to integrate computer
algebra calculation in his course. He already has examples and ideas
how to use SageMath to creatively improve problem solving in
mechanics. He wants to use a single system for both his own
experiments with algebra involved in mechanics and for authoring
materials for students. Additionally, he wants students to be able to:

- work with examples which are published and create own
  solutions of given problems and return then for grading.

- perform simple and short interaction with a code or unser interface
  during a lecture or a tutorial

- read printed version of lecture notes.

## Suggestion of solution


1.  He uses [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org)  with SageMath kernel,
    mixing prose, code, visualization, together with resources: source
    code, data, media;

2.  He publishes them on a publicly hosted repository using [a
    template](https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/authoring_cookie_cutter). In
    this example the repository is [Binder-ready](/tag/binder); for
    details, see the [Binder documentation](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using.html#preparing-a-repository-for-binder)
    
4.  He shares the link to the repository with students.


## Some instances

- [Mechanics with SageMath](https://github.com/marcinofulus/Mechanics_with_SageMath),

## Discussion


By publishing the course materials in the form of notebooks and using
provided the template repository, John easily achevies following:

1. He can compile selected notebooks to a book form using LaTeX
typesetting software. It can be printed and used in non-interactive
way as a regular book.

2. Using Binder, notebooks can be launched at any time without any
authorization. In this way is it possible to use in during lecture or
a tutorial as live interactive examples.

3. The repository can be cloned and on students computers. This allows
for individual work of students on their assignments or exploration of
the subject.


## Time and expertise required

Assuming John is familiar with version control and Jupyter (basic lab
skills taught at [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/),
and is fluent in using Jupyter notebook, the initial setup of the
course repository could take few hours the first time. Further
developement should not generate any significant overhead compared to
regular use of Jupyter notebook.

## What's new since OpenDreamKit started

- Apparition of [Binder](http://mybinder.org);
- Expansion of the [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org) technology;
- Providing demontrators as examples of using interactive books
  technology in practice.
- Providing 3d visualization software which can extent application of Jupyter
  notebook rely on 3d visualisation (e.g. fluid dynamics)
