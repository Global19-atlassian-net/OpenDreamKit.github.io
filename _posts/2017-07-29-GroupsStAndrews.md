## OpenDreamKit at Groups St Andrews in Birmingham ##

[http://www.groupsstandrews.org/](Groups St Andrews) is a conference series 
with a conference every four years. This year's Groups St Andrews will be in
Birmingham, and I will attend, bring a [public/public/groups-st-andrews-2017.pdf](poster),
give a contributed talk about computing in permutation groups, and teach a course on GAP.

This post serves the main purpose of providing a page on the OpenDreamKit website
that can hold all the links that will appear on the poster, and possible further
information.
