title: St. Andrews Workshop explored "Math-in-the-Middle" Paradigm for Integration
---
The OpenDreamKit Team held a workshop on knowledge representation to synchronize views and
start coding for Work Package WP6
... [details/program](http://opendreamkit.org/2015/12/08/WP6StAndrewsMeeting/).

The 15 participants explored the
[Math-in-the-Middle Architecture](meetings/2016-01-25-DKS/kohlhase_slides.pdf)
(originally introduced as Knowledge-First-Strategy) introduced by the WP6 leader and they
started coding towards realizing it.

This information architecutre uses a central mathematical ontology represented in
OMDoc/MMT as a central vocabulary for specifying system behaviors and capabilities, while
documenting the maths involved to users.
