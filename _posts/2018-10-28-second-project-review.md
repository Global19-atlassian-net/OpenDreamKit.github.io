On October 30th of 2018, OpenDreamKit underwent its second formal review by
the European Commission, represented by three reviewers and our former
and new project officers. About twenty five of us came to Luxembourg to
present our achievements during the second period of the project
(March 2017 to August 2018), including
[18 deliverables](https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+label%3Adeliverable+label%3AReportingPeriod2+).
See our [reports](/project/reports/#reporting-period-2).

After
[two days of rehearsals](https://opendreamkit.org/meetings/2018-10-28-Luxembourg/),
we had one day of
[presentations and software demonstrations](https://opendreamkit.org/meetings/2018-10-28-Luxembourg/ProjectReview/),
which all came up as quite a show.

Up to a legitimate complaint about our financial reports being
delivered very late by our administrations and some other minor points,
**the feedback was once again very positive**, with language such as
"very good technical work", "very good sustainability plan", "very
good management work considering difficulty of managing large project
with many and challenging goals", "you have done extremely well", "we
urge you to apply for future funding". They also pointed out the
spirit, the passion, and the unity of our team despite its size. This
is apparently not that common among EU projects.

As for the last review, we had made a strong point in our reports and
presentations that a vast majority of what's happening comes from the
ecosystem we support. All we do is exploit the special resources the
EU is entrusting us to knock down some tough hurdles that are
preventing the ball to roll. **Big kudos to our communities!**

We have now entered OpenDreamKit's third and last period. In one year
day to day, we will be presenting the outcome of four years of hard
work. Hopefully by then we will have secured future funding in one
form or the other to keep supporting our ecosystem.
