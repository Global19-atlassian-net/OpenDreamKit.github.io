 Advertise capabilities of OpenDreamKit with a research talk
that showcases the GAP Jupyter interface.

interface as part of a research seminar talk on search in permutation groups.

## Results and impact

 
This seminar talk was a good opportunity to advertise OpenDreamKit outside of
our core developer or user groups.
