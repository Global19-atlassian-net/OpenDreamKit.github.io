## OpenDreamKit implication




OpenDreamKit participants: B. Allombert, K. Belabas, V. Delecroix, J. Demeyer,
J.-P. Flori, L. de Feo.

OpenDreamKit provided the main funding source for the workshop (accommodation,
subsistence and travel expenses), for about 13k Euro. The Lyon
institute of mathematics (Institut Camille Jordan) co-funded the event.

## Event summary




The 7th Atelier PARI/GP took place in Lyon (France) from january
9th to 13th.

There were 43 registered participants from 19 different institutions
(no registration fees).

A typical day of the workshop had introductory talks and tutorials
in the morning; afternoons allowed ample time for hacking sessions,
discussions and training.

The Atelier featured 10 morning talks on mathematical topics and
implementation projects including 4 talks by OpenDreamKit members


* Karim Belabas ``Using GIT with PARI'', ``$L$-functions'' and
  ``Dirichlet characters''
* Bill Allombert ``New GP features''



Slides for all talks are available at

## Results and impact





The workshop was very productive and particularly beneficial to WP5
(high-performance computing). It also was a successful dissemination event: half
  the participants had not come to a previous Atelier.
