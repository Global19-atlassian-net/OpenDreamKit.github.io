## Main goals

 We introduced the basics of computational micromagnetics as well as taught the participants how to run JOOMMF simulations.

## OpenDreamKit implication

 JOOMMF was developed as a part of the OpenDreamKit project and two participants from the OpenDreamKit project were present to deliver the workshop (Marijan Beg, and Ryan A. Pepper). The workshop was co-funded by the conference organisers and the EPSRC CCP Computational Magnetism Network (EP/M022668/1) grant. No costs of the workshop were paid from the OpenDreamKit funds.

## Event summary

 In this workshop we provided a brief introduction to computational micromagnetics. We introduced and taught the use of a Python interface to drive the OOMMF simulation package. At the beginning of the workshop, we provided a lecture style introduction, which was followed by practical exercises where attendees had an opportunity to carry out small micromagnetic calculations, modify given examples and ask more specific questions. Several days after the main event, we held a follow up session, where we were able to talk to participants about their specific needs, get requests for features, and get general feedback.

## Demographic

 We had 57 participants, but the organizers did not allow us to have their personal details.

## Results and impact

 During the workshop we received the feedback from the participants about our Python interface to OOMMF as well as gained experience which helped us to structure future workshops.
