## Plan

1.  OpenDreamKit?

1.  The making of: brief history (from coordinator's perspective)

1.  The making of: approach

1.  To run or not to run for a EU project?

1.  Good luck and more reading

Note:

This is a talk I delivered at a meeting organized by platform Wiskunde
Netherlands, NWO, and Yellow Research to encourage Dutch
mathematicians to apply for EU funding.

## OpenDreamKit (2015-2019)

<center>
  Open Digital Research Environment Toolkit<br>
  for the Advancement of Mathematics<br>
  [OpenDreamKit.org](OpenDreamKit.org)
</center>

**Work Programme**: [Horizon 2020](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/), [European Research Infrastructures](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en/h2020-section/european-research-infrastructures-including-e-infrastructures)

**Call**: Virtual Research Environments

**Budget**: 7.6 M€

**Aim**: support the ecosystem of open source software for **pure maths and applications**
- Software engineering: portability, interoperability, distribution, HPC, ...
- Jupyter-based interactive environments

**Consortium**: [15 sites, 50 participants](http://opendreamkit.org/partners), ... together with the international community!

## The making of: for me it all started there

<center><img src="/public/images/haut2.jpg" alt="just a nice picture" width="60%"/></center>

Note:
- Since 20 years, I am doing research in algebraic combinatorics. And
  like about everybody here, computer exploration is a fundamental tool.

- I am also am a big fan of free software, both from the ethics and practical
  points of view

- From the beginning a big fan of software packages like GAP, Singular, Pari
  demonstrated that, with a few dedicated leaders, whole communities
  of researchers could get together, and share their work, and build
  the tools they need.

- I wanted the same in my community. One constraint is that we
  need a platform that integrates together tools from many different
  areas of maths. So I ended up being a happy Sage developer.

- For a long time, to keep being happy, I strived hard to not
  depend on funding so that I could focus on coding and community
  building.  But with time it became tricky.

## What really got me started

**A question of Bruce Westbury at [FPSAC 2013](http://fpsac.org) in Paris:**

    *Given unlimited funding, what would you do with it for Sage?*

## Timeline

**Before 2014:**

Basic idea: seek funding for

- A couple full time developers
- Community building

Several unlucky attempts: ANR, ...

{% include vspace.html %}

**Early 2014:** Our EU office suggests a call

** January 2015:** Proposal submitted

** May 2015:** Proposal accepted

** September 2015:** Project starts

----
## Detailed timeline

### January to August 2014

- Seek information on the H2020 Programm
- Reach the broad community
- First five page draft
- Choice of a potential call

{% include vspace.html %}

### September 2014

- Meeting with 12 potential participants
- Analyze the needs
- First list of tasks, work packages
- Reconfiguration of the consortium

----

### October 2014 to January 2015

- Writing
- Reconfiguration of work packages
- More reaching toward the broad community
- Extension of the consortium consortium
- Writing, writing, writing, ...

{% include vspace.html %}

### May 2015 to August 2015

- Acceptation, Préparation, Launch

{% include vspace.html %}

### September 2015

- Kickoff

---

## The making of: approach

### Follow my dreams

- Open source, open data, open publications, **open proposal**

- Bottom up:
    - analyze and collect the needs of our community
    - choose a call accordingly
    - find a story that binds them all

----

### Engage the community, foster collective intelligence

{% include vspace.html %}

#### Open Proposal

- Broad invitation to participate to the definition of the project
- Public writing of the project

{% include vspace.html %}

#### Develop and share the **vision** on the project

- Who are we?
- What are our aims?
- Where do we start from?
- What is our strategy?
- How does this project relate to other projects?
- Why are we the dream team for the task?

----

### Empower the participants

#### Encourage

- to jointly define the vision of the project
- to do what they think is right (they know better)

{% include vspace.html %}

#### Enable

- What's the status of the proposal?
- What remains to do?
- How can they help?

{% include vspace.html %}

#### Smile, run forward, and hope ... and be thankful

----

### Collaborative tools: a key to success

#### Scale

- 100 pages
- 20 coauthors
- 3000 e-mails; 400 on the last two days

Forget about: Word, Dropbox, ...

----

### Collaborative tools: some recommendations

#### Proposal writing

- Version control and forge: e.g. [GitHub](github.com) or [GitLab](gitlab.com)
- Automate whatever you can: tables, graphics, computation of the budget, ...
- Source files in text: for example LateX + [proposal](http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/proposal) style file

{% include vspace.html %}

#### Communication

- General discussions and progress tracking: mailing list, e.g. on sympa
- Discussions on specific topics: e.g. GitHub issues
- Videoconferences: [appear.in](appear.in) / [hubl.in](hubl.in) / [framatalk.org](framatalk.org)
- Chat: gitter / slack / ...
- Live text editing and note taking: e.g. [hackmd.io](hackmd.io)

{% include vspace.html %}

<center>Train, train, train your team; learn, learn, learn</center>

----

### Getting external help

#### Delegate to a specialized company?

- They will crunch your freedom. And your money.
- Get good collaborative tools instead.

{% include vspace.html %}
{% include vspace.html %}

#### Get a few good counselors!

- Your local European Affair service
- People with previous experience running a project
- Needed as well for launching the project
- Plan for a part time admin if you can

---

## To run or not to run for a EU project?

### Costs

#### Preparation

- Three months full time for the coordinator
- A few months spread over the other participants
- 3000 € (travel + one meeting)

#### Launching

- Two months full time for the coordinator
- 1000 € (web site, travel, ...)

#### Running

- A solid fourth of my time: administration + coordination
- Plus doing the work itself: engineering + research

----

### Benefits

{% include vspace.html %}

- Means to achieve what you care about: funding, manpower

{% include vspace.html %}

- Opportunities to grow your skills, your network, your vision

{% include vspace.html %}

- An amazing human experience

{% include vspace.html length="10%" %}

- Incidentally: not bad for your career

  But: you **will** be asked to take more responsibilities

----
## To run or not to run for a EU project?

- What are the needs of your community?<br>
  Can funding actually help?

- Do you have the time and energy?

- Do you have good administrative support?

- Do you have experience coordinating people?

{% include vspace.html %}

- Do you have a dream?<br>Something you care enough about to devote a
  good chunk of your life? of your research?

{% include vspace.html %}

- Are you ready for an adventure?

---

## Good luck!

### And if it works, never forget:

- You have been very lucky

- You will be entrusted funds **by the citizen** and **for your community**

- You won't own them, but be responsible for their best use
