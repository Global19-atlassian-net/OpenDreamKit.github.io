The ultimate purpose of a mathematical VRE is to create data (D), knowledge (K), and software (S) by modeling world situations, computing mathematical objects, and running computational experiments. To be effective a VRE needs an infrastructure that supports the creation, management, access, and dissemination of D/K/S-Structures. All the systems considered in this proposal (GAP, SAGE, PARI, SINGULAR, OEIS, arXiv.org, . . . ) already include data, knowledge, and software modules as part of their regular distribution, but not in a form that is interoperable between systems, severely limiting the usefulness of the systems and results. 

## Objectives 

* to design a flexible, knowledge-based integration layer for the OpenDreamKit Systems
* to integrate large-scale data sources into the VRE and make them accessible programmatically at the math level 

## Knowledge-based Integration of Systems 

## Integration of Knowledge and Data Sources.
