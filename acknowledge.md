1)	EU visibility

OpenDreamKit being funded by Horizon 2020, the EU asks us to promote its financial support. The obligation for EU visibility includes:

-	Peer-reviewed publications, posters, presentations at seminars or workshops and other main research dissemination
-	Project major communication activity: project website, and as far as possible communication in the media
-	Audio-visual material (interviews, promotional videos etc)
-	Infrastructure and major results funded by the grant

!!! This does not include your day-to-day research and collaborations !!!

For the communication actions and dissemination listed above, they must:

(a)	Display the EU emblem

(b)	Include the following text:

(i)	For communication activities: ``We acknowledge financial support from the
[OpenDreamKit](http://opendreamkit.org/)
[Horizon 2020](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/)
[European Research Infrastructures](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en/h2020-section/european-research-infrastructures-including-e-infrastructures)
project (#<a href="http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/198334_en.html">676541</a>).''

(ii)	For infrastructure, equipment and major results: “This infrastructure/equipment is part of a project that has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 676541”.

2)	Disclaimer

Major communication productions must include when possible a fixed text indicating the content reflects only the author’s view (and not the EU point of view). 
The text is as following

“This publication/website/video/etc has been produced with the assistance of the European Union. The contents of this publication are the sole responsibility of [name of the author(s)] and can in no way be taken to reflect the views of the European Union.”

Are concerned:
-     Peer-reviewed publications, posters, presentations at seminars or workshops and other main research dissemination
-	Project major communication activity: project website, and as far as possible communication in the media
-	Audio-visual material (interviews, promotional videos etc)


3)	Communication to get the project as widely known as possible!!

-	I hope the logo to be definitely adopted (maybe by an online poll?) soon in order to start using it. Once it is adopted I will be able to set up a visual identity for the project (link graphically somehow the website, the logo and written documents which will be sent to the Commission and available to the public).

-	I’ll bring the subject of a communication plan to the steering committee in January, which will contain the already planned major dissemination events and some ideas to discuss in order to get the as most people interested in us as possible.

-	Eventually, it is up to everyone to get the project successful in the open software community and beyond. Take all the opportunities you can to talk about OpenDreamKit and its objectives. 


PLEASE: remember to contact me and Viviane Pons who is in charge of the dissemination work package for major communication and dissemination results and actions (press releases, interviews, publications…)! You can contact us before the actions if you have any doubt concerning visibility or else, but most importantly after the results of the actions in order to promote them on the website.
