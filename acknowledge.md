# EU visibility

OpenDreamKit being funded by Horizon 2020, the EU asks us to promote its financial support. The obligation for EU visibility includes:

  -	Peer-reviewed publications, posters, presentations at seminars or workshops and other main research dissemination
  -	Project major communication activity: project website, and as far as possible communication in the media
  -	Audio-visual material (interviews, promotional videos etc)
  -	Infrastructure and major results funded by the grant

!!! This of course does not include your day-to-day research and collaborations !!!

For the communication actions and dissemination listed above, they must:

(a)	Display the EU emblem whenever possible

    (typically publications in our field do not traditionaly include such logos or emblems) 

(b)	Include the following text:

  -  For communication activities: "We acknowledge financial support from the

project (#<a href="http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/198334_en.html">676541</a>).''

  -  For infrastructure, equipment and major results: “This infrastructure/equipment is part of a project that has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 676541”.

# EU Disclaimer

The text is as following:

PLEASE: remember to contact Benoît Pilorget and Viviane Pons who are in charge of the project management and of the dissemination work package for major communication and dissemination results and actions (press releases, interviews, publications…)! You can contact them before the actions if you have any doubt concerning visibility or else, but most importantly after the results of the actions in order to promote them on the website.
