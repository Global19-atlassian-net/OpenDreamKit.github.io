## Defining Key Performance Indicators

Very difficult for an opensource project:
 - VRE toolkit, not VRE deployments themselves
 - Citability in collaborative software is much harder than academic papers
 - Difficulty in claiming credit for 100% of the impact
---
## Types of Key Performance Indicators

 - OpenDreamKit's website statistics
 - Downloads/installs (but parts of larger systems, different from new users, etc)
 - Citation counts of specific papers (consortium papers, but lag)
 - Breakdown workshop attendance counts
 - contribution measurements on software
 - **success stories**

---
## Disclaimer
### The variation of indicators between RP1 and RP2 will need to be interpreted
---
## KPI 1: More effective collaborations between researchers
---

## KPI process: some internal feedback for the 1st Reporting Period

 - Dificulty in choosing the msot meaningful indicators
 - We could do better, and compiling them this time taught us a lesson. 
 - Need to document the process itself
