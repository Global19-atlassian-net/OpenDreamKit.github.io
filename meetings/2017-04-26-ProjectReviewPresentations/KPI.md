## Defining Key Performance Indicators

Very difficult for an opensource project:
 - VRE toolkit, not VRE deployments themselves
 - Citability in collaborative software is much harder than academic papers
 - Difficulty in claiming credit for 100% of the impact
---
## Types of Key Performance Indicators

 - OpenDreamKit's website statistics
 - Downloads/installs (but parts of larger systems, different from new users, etc)
 - Breakdown workshop attendance counts
 - Contribution measurements on software
 - **success stories**

---
## Disclaimer
### The variation of indicators between RP1 and RP2 will need to be interpreted
---
## KPI 1: More effective collaborations between researchers
---
### Number of Jupyter kernels
- September 2015: 49
- April 2017: [87 kernels](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels)

### Nr of Social Media followers (Twitter): 271  followers on April 2017

---
## KPI 2: Higher efficiency and creativity in research, higher productivity of researchers thanks to reliable and easy access to discovery, access and re-use of data
---
### Number of users of Sagemathcloud: Feb. 2016 to Feb 2017

#### Exemple of a high impact publication

[The L-Functions and Modular Forms Database Project](https://www.openaire.eu/en/search/publication?articleId=core_ac_uk__::bac82a8fe3e313ae79db60e152a36c54), by J. Cremona, 2016

*Attention score of 33: in the top 5% of research outputs scored by Altmetric*

### Nr of publications citing ODK or one of its components:
- Altmetric and Openaire support contacted in January 2017: no answer yet
--
### Nr of tutorial attendees in RP1
- 4 tutorials organised
- 160 people targeted
---
## KPI process: some internal feedback for the 1st Reporting Period

 - Dificulty in choosing the most meaningful indicators
 - Documenting needs to be done to repeat measurements for RP2
