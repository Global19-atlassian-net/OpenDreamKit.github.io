## SageMathCloud for teaching

My first experiment: a mathematic and computer science project for first year students

--
### First year students

* don't know much
* are not very autonomous
* often lack motivation

### I asked...

* difficult things
* with little explanations
* and lots of freedom

--
### And it worked!

2 phases

**Phase 1** Learn SageMath and python using notebooks on SageMathCloud


**Phase 2** Work on challenging projects in the SageMathCloud environment

--

[Demo](../laby.webm)

### I am not the only one...

An OpenDreamKit anectdote

---
## What is our work in OpenDreamKit?

We build a **toolkit**: we give the means for improving and creating VRE

* improve the existing tools (Jputer, SageMathCloud)
* reduce the technical barrier
* improve interoperability
* and more...
