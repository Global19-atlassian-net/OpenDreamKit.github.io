## What is SageMathCloud?

An **open-soucre** online platform created in 2013 offering virtual machines for scientific collaboration.

This is a **service provider** built **on top** of many existing software (including OpenDreamKit components) and part of the **Open Source ecosystem**.

## SageMathCloud for teaching

My first experiment: a mathematic and computer science project for first year students

--
### First year students

* don't know much
* are not very autonomous
* often lack motivation

--
### I asked...

* difficult things
* with little explanations
* and lots of freedom

--
### And it worked!

2 phases

**Phase 1** Learn SageMath and python using notebooks on SageMathCloud

--
**Phase 2** Work on challenging projects in the SageMathCloud environment

[Demo](../laby.webm)

--
### I am not the only one...

An OpenDreamKit anecdote

---
## How does this relate to OpenDreamKit?

We build a **toolkit**: we give the means for improving and creating VREs

--
## We rely on each other

SageMathCloud **relies** on many of OpenDreamKit software: Jupyter, Sage, and more...

SageMathCloud gives us a great way to **reach our users** by reducing the technical barrier.

## Beyond SageMathCloud

SageMathCloud is **one** example, but it does not answer the great variety of needs that arise.  

**Goal: Give an ecosystem of solutions that work together**

## Use SageMathCloud expertise
