## Some background...

OpenDreamKit is built upon many communities of very active users and developers:

- different software 
- different research fields

---
## Our main goal

Improve and support those existing communities and turn the technical progress we do in OpenDreamKit into
**better science and research**.

--
## Our main goal

- **Community building**: Organizing workshops and conferences to reinforce our communities
- **Training**: Widespread our shared technical knowledge especially concerning new OpenDreamKit development
- **Dissemination and outreach**: foster larger communities, get new users and new developers
- **Exploitation**: make effective use of OpenDreamKit development in science and research

## Dissemination events

T2.5: Dissemination: reaching towards users and fostering diversity

T2.7: Open source dissemination of micromagnetic VRE

T2.8: Micromagnetic VRE dissemination workshops

--

 - 6 SageDays on specific math-related topics
 - Sage training in developing countries
 - 14 talks (SciPy, EuroSciPy, CICM, ICMS,...)
 - **4 Micromagnetic VRE dissemination workshops**
 - Jupyter Day (Orsay, Nov. 2016)

##  Computational Mathematics with Jupyter

![](../ICMS_Jan2017.jpg)

--
- 5-days workshop at the International Centre for Mathematical Sciences (Edinburgh, January 2017)
- [47 participants from 10 countries](http://opendreamkit.org/meetings/2017-01-16-ICMS/participants/) 
- About half of the program consisted of lectures and tutorials
- The other half - collaborative coding and documentation sprints in parallel break-out groups, often suggested by participants
- This format is most efficient for the dissemination, allowing attendees to try out new tools themselves
- Covered many tools from the Python and Juputer ecosystems and their use in research and teaching

## Micromagnetic VRE and JOOMMF

### Overview

Integration of Object Oriented Micro Magnetic Framework (OOMMF) into Jupyter
- Python interface to OOMMF (completed)
- multi-media integration (equations, plots, geometries) into Notebook (ongoing)
- dissemination through workshops, preferred at major conferences
- Hosting in the cloud (future)

--
### Workshops

- 61st Annual Conference on Magnetism and Magnetic Materials in New Orleans, LA, USA (2nd and 3rd November 2016).
- Spring Meeting of the Condensed Matter Section in Dresden, Germany (19th March 2017)
- Institute of Physics Magnetism 2017 conference in York, UK (5th April 2017)
- IEEE International Magnetics Conference - Intermag 2017, Dublin, Ireland (24th April 2017)

## Women In Sage

January 2017, 19 participants

![](/public/images/womenInSage/group_photo_small.jpg)

--
### Goal: reduce the gender-gap

By targeting women, we reach a population that is often left out in classical events.

!["I had never heard of Sage Days": 35.3%, "I thought Sage Days were not for me": 11.8%, "I wanted to but never had the time nor the occasion": 17.6% , 
"I attended once": 17.6%, "I attended many times": 17.6%](/public/images/womenInSage/sage-days-attendance.png)


--
### Bring more women to Sage by helping through this first step

![What are the chances you attend a "normal" sage days in the future? 1:0 people, 2: 0 people, 3: 5 people, 4: 2 people, 5: 10 people](/public/images/womenInSage/future_sage_days.png)

--
### Very encouraging results

Contributions on [14 tickets](https://trac.sagemath.org/search?q=days82) during the week, 
6 of those which have been merged since the conference. 

**8 first contributions to sage source code**

And a high rate of satisfaction.

![How did you like the general atmosphere of the conference? 1:0 people, 2: 0 people, 3: 0 people, 4: 0 people, 5: 17 people](/public/images/womenInSage/atmosphere.png)
