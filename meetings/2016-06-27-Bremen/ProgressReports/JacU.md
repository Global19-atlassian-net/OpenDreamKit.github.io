## Role in the OpenDreamKit Project

* Responsible for WP6: "Data/Knowledge/Software-Bases" (46 PM)
* Our Interpretation Integrating D/K/S for system  integration  (towards VRE)
* Participating in WP4: "User Interfaces" (12PM)
* Our interpretation:  math documents as Knowledge-Based UI for Math Systems
* KWARC much better integrated in ODK than anticipated (foundational interests)

## Financial and administrative setup

- everything OK

---

## Hiring

hired a research software engineer (Dr. Christian Maeder) for 6 months and two Ph.D. students
(Xu He and Tom Wiesing)  on 1/4 contracts. 

---

## Achievements

* St. Andrews Workshop on WP6 with 15 participants (from JacU, ParisSud, Versailles,
  Warwick, UZH, StAndrews)
* Developed Math-in-the-Middle (MitM) paradigm for integrating open-source components into a VRE
* Implementing the basic setup for the MitM paradigm of intetration for St. Andrews.
* Working on MathHub.info portal and the underlying MMT-based build system.
* good progress  on parsing OEIS data set.
* ODK/MitM paper  at [CICM](http://cicm-conference.org/2016) 
* OEIS paper at  [ICMS](http://icms2016.zib.de/) 
* First (baby) steps towards a computational foundation.

## Deliverables

* D4.2 Active/Structured Documents Requirements and existing Solutions
* D6.1 Full-text Search (Formulae + Keywords) over LaTeX-based Documents (e.g. the arXiv subset)

---

## Main upcoming tasks and deliverables

* D4.3 (Due: September 2016) Distributed, Collaborative, Versioned Editing of Active Documents in MathHub.info
* D6.2 (Due: September 2016) Initial DKS base Design (including base survey and Requirements Workshop Report)
* D6.3 (Due: December 2016) Design of Triform (DKS) Theories (Specification/RNC Schema/Examples) and Implementation of Triform Theories in the MMT API  
* D4.8 (Due: April 2017 ) In-place computation in active documents (context/computation)

## Possibly Relevant Events

* 25-19 July 2016 [CICM Conference](http://cicm-conference.org/2016) (Conference on Intelligent Computer Mathematics).
  * relevant Tracks: CALCULEMUS & MKM
* 11-14 July 2016 [ICMS Conference](http://icms2016.zib.de/) (International Conference on Mathematical Software)
  * Track on WDML and Math Software/Data/Knoweldge Information Systems.
