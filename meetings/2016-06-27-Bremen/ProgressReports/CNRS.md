## Financial and administrative setup

- Everything on rails: money arrived, first expenses done,
  we were even allowed to use some of the overhead.

- Signature of the consortium agreement is a bit of a
  labyrinth but finally it looks like it will be done soon!

## Hiring

- failed to recruit an ingeneer on time: only 2 reasonable
  candidates among the 20 auditions and they did not take
  the job (September 2015). We are in the process of hiring
  an ingeneer for September 2016.
