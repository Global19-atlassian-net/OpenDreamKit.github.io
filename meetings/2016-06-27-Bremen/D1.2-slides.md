## Templates of inspiration

Pilot action on open access to research data for e-infrastructure projects

- No official template available at the time
- Inspiration from DMP template from Sorbonne Universités (template advised by the CNRS)
- DMP V1 focused on open access procedures & datasets
---

## Work procedure


- Each site was asked to define datasets they are using on OpenDreamKit
- Datasets uploaded on an online document via Github OpenDreamkit repository
- Datasets were recompiled: datasets according to data type and not according to site


---

## Data responsibility & Resources for openaccess

- DMP linked to legal statements in the Grant Agreement and the OpenDreamKit Consortium Agreement

- Basis: all the work done within OpenDreamKit is public and available in open access

---

## Datasets

- Most datasests concern addition to open software codebase
- Some datasets are lacking: Singular data information etc -> an improvement to bring for V2
- Skeleton of datasets:
	- Data storage and security
	- Dissemination
	- Preservation and future access
	- Partners involved
	- + Nature of data, licence (when relevant), data standard, usage for further experiments, lik to data (storage)

---

## Openaccess

- Publication
	- [Publishers' policies](www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/): accept only six months embargo
		=> all data linked to publication sent to Coordinator once peer-reviewed publication is given open access
	- Publication data published on http://zenodo.org/
	- Publication published on an openaccess platform
	- Linkage between openaccess paltform and Zenodo on OpenAire

---

## Next step

- Define what DATA is for OpenDreamKit?
- Data storage/access/security policies per partner and/or dataset
- Gather lacking information on datasets
- Advice??
