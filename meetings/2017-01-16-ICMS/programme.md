Here we collect items for the programme of the 
[Computational Mathematics with Jupyter](http://opendreamkit.org/meetings/2017-01-16-ICMS/) workshop.
Please watch this page for updates!

We plan to hold presentations and tutorials during morning sessions, and 
coding and documentation sprints during afternoon sessions. The schedule
of the morning sessions will be determined prior to the workshop. 
Actitivies that will take place in the afternoons and their schedule will 
be decided at the beginning of the workshop dependently on how many people 
will sign up to the proposed coding and documentation sprints.

## Presentations and tutorials

* Mike Croucher: Is your research software correct?

* Mike Croucher: ["An introduction to SageMathCloud' for lecturers"](https://github.com/mikecroucher/SMC_tutorial)

* Raniere Silva: Software Sustainability on Computational Mathematics

* Thomas Kluyver: (exact title TBC)

* Christian Lawson-Perfect: [Numbas](http://www.numbas.org.uk/) (exact title TBC) 

* Alexander Konovalov: Reproducible computational experiments using [GAP Docker containers](https://hub.docker.com/u/gapsystem/)


## Coding and documentation sprints

The following coding and documentation sprints were suggested so far

* Improving documentation for ["An introduction to SageMathCloud' for lecturers"](https://github.com/mikecroucher/SMC_tutorial) (lead: Mike Croucher)

* Developing Software Carpentry lesson on SageMath (leads: Alexander Konovalov, Raniere Silva)

* Tools for computations in semigroups (lead: James Mitchell)

* Contributing to [STACK](https://moodle.org/plugins/qtype_stack) (exact title TBC) (lead: Chris Sangwin)

* Lecture notes hackathon: bring your lecture notes to convert them to Jupyter notebooks.
