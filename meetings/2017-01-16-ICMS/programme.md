Here we collect items for the programme of the 
[Computational Mathematics with Jupyter](http://opendreamkit.org/meetings/2017-01-16-ICMS/) workshop.
Please watch this page for updates!

We plan to hold presentations and tutorials during morning sessions, and 
coding and documentation sprints during afternoon sessions. The schedule
of the morning sessions will be determined prior to the workshop. 
Actitivies that will take place in the afternoons and their schedule will 
be decided at the beginning of the workshop dependently on how many people 
will sign up to the proposed coding and documentation sprints.
