title: Computational Mathematics with Jupyter
---

This workshop will take place at the 
[International Centre for Mathematical Sciences](http://www.icms.org.uk/)
in Edinburgh on 16-20 January 2017. It is organised jointly by the 
[OpenDreamKit](http://opendreamkit.org/) and [CoDiMa](http://www.codima.ac.uk/)
projects.

We invite developers and users with programming experience (at least at the 
beginner's level) interested in [SageMath](http://www.sagemath.org/), 
[GAP](http://www.gap-system.org/), [Singular](https://www.singular.uni-kl.de/),
[Python](https://www.python.org/), [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/), and related 
projects and using them in research and/or teaching.

The workshop will have format similar to previous [SageMath days](https://wiki.sagemath.org/Workshops) 
and [GAP days](http://gapdays.de/). Approximately a half of the activities will be in the form of 
lectures and tutorials, and the other half would consist of collaborative coding and documentation 
sprints in parallel break-out groups, suggested by participants (to see some anticipated activities,
see [this discussion](https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/issues/208) on GitHub).

The focus of the workshop is on various components from the [Jupyter's ecosystem](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/architecture/visual_overview.html) and
related projects such as, for example, Jupyter notebooks kernels for mathematical
software systems, and their applications in research, training and teaching.
