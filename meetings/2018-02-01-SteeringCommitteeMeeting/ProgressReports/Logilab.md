## Achievements

Publication of a new version of the Pythran library that allows to
compile Python code into HPC-optimized high performance code. See
http://serge-sans-paille.github.io/pythran-stories/toward-a-simpler-and-faster-pythran-compiler.html

Publication of a new version of the SciViJS library for
post-processing and visualizing 3D datasets with a full javascript
library that can be used inside or outside Jupyter notebooks. This
version can use post-processing plugins written in javascript or in
C++ compiled with WebAssembly. See
https://hg.logilab.org/review/scivijs

## Work in progress

Study of the impact of the use of the Pythran compiler inside SageMath
and SciPy where computational algorithms might benefit from a
HPC-optimized code.

Integration of Pythran into Cython in order to use Pythran optimized
code for some computational operations (NumPy or standard library).

Library for exporting code samples from Sphinx documents into a set of
Jupyter notebooks and for integrating back the code outputs computed
by Jupyter into the Sphinx documents.
