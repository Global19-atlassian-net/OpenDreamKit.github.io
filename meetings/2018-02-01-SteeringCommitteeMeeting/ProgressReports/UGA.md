## Hiring

* Hongguang Zhu, research engineer 100%
  * 1 September 2017 -- 30 August 2019
  * Formerly research assistant at Univ. of Sherbrooke, QC, Canada.
  * Working on distributed code for LinBox (D5.14)

## Achievements

* Releases of
  + givaro-4.0.3 and givaro-4.0.4:
    - improving build system,
    - autodetection of SIMD
    - micro-instruction,
    - enhancing robustness
  + fflas-ffpack-2.3.0, fflas-ffpack-2.3.1 and fflas-ffpack-2.3.2:
    - new code for exact symmetric triangular factorization, triangular inversion, parallel matrix-vector product, etc
    - improved build system
    - enhancing robustness
    - major cleanup
    - increased coverage of the test-suite
  + linbox-1.5.0 linbox-1.5.1 and linbox-1.5.2:
    - enhancing robustness
    - reworked polynomial interface
    - improving build system

* Integration of these latest releases in SageMath:
  + [https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24214]
  + fixing several long lasting bugs
  + speeding-up end-user routines: e.g. the characteristic polynomial of a dense matrix over a modular finite field.

* A new recursive algorithm for the symmetric indefinite triangular factorization revealing the rank profile matrix (article submitted and implementation available upstream in fflas-ffpack)

* New protocols for the probabilistic interractive certification of the signature, the determinant and the rank profile matrix (article at ISSAC'17, and extended version submitted to J. of Symbolic Computation).
