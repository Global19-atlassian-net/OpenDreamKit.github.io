## Achievements

- 1st Review: the [review of the first Reporting Period (18 months)](http://opendreamkit.org/meetings/2017-04-26-ProjectReviewPresentations/) took place in Brusels on the 26/04/2017. All in all all the wokr due for M18 was done and therefore the overall feedback was very positive from our Project Officer and reviewers. See Nicolas Thiéry's [debriefing notes](http://opendreamkit.org/2017/04/26/first-project-review-debriefing/) for more information.

- 2nd amendment: this amendment was due to the addition of FAU and XFEL in the consortium and the termination of Southampton. These modifications were made to enable Michael Kohlhase's and Hans Fangiohr's teams to remain in the consortium.

- 3rd amendment: this amendment was due to the terminations of Jacobsuni and UZH, and the modification of the workplan. The two partners cited were no longer in a position to play their part in the cosnortium for the following reasons: all resources spent, no more relevant eprsonnel remaining.
In addition to this the amendment reshuffled the workplan, in particular: new milestones were added, Key Perdormande Indicators were modified, the number of deliverables was reduced and reamining work on WP7 was integrated in other tasks:
  - Objective 6 cancelled 
  - T7.4 integrated in T2.8
  - T7.1, T7.2 and T7.3 cancelled and related resources were transfered in favour of T2.6, T3.3, T3.3 and T5.7
 
 All changes were implemented in the [github repository](https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/milestones). This amendment is currently being to be definitely signed by the Commission. UPSUD will make an announcement and make public the new version of the Grant when it is signed.

## Work in progress

- OpenDreamKit and EOSC:
  - Strategy: N. Thiéry, B. Pilorget and H. Fangohr participated last November to two events in Brussels dedicated to the the future European Open Science Cloud (EOSC). We aimed at understanding this future network and what opportunities it offers for our communities. A [blogpost](http://opendreamkit.org/2017/12/06/EOSC/) was written on the matter. For the time being, ODK has nto yet expressed official support to EOSCThe steering committee is welcome to express their interest or disinterest in this project.
  
   -Partnership with EGI (main stakeholder of the EOSC)

There is an existing collaboration between EGI and OpenDreamKit for the deployment of JupyterHub in EGI services. A Technology Provider Agreement must be signed between EGI and OpenDreamKit/Jupyter developers in the next weeks. Depending on the success of this joint work and of the need of the EOSC post-2020, the collaboration could be extended.
