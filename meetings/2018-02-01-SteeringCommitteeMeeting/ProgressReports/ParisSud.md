## Hiring

### 1 postdoc on WP6

UPSUD hired on the O1/01/2018 , and for a duration of 18 months, Dr Florian Rabe as Postdoc. He will be working half-time on WP6 and WP4. Florian will be spending the other half of his time at FAU with Pr. Kohlhase working on the same thematics.

### Three part-time trainees on Communication

Elisabeth Pluquet, Jeannette Nwedeck, Dilan Kocabey. The three of them are on their second year of Master's degree in digital communciation.Half of their time is spent in a company, the other half is spent working on two academic projects with their teacher. OpenDreamKit is one of this projects. Monitored by B. Pilorget and V. Pons their work focuses on: writing a communication plan, developing the website towards end-users, and creating media (videos, articles, interview etc.) to help us communicate and disseminate outside our communities.

## Achievements

### 1st Review

The [review of the first Reporting Period (18 months)](http://opendreamkit.org/meetings/2017-04-26-ProjectReviewPresentations/)

was organized in Brussels by Paris Sud on the 26th of April 2017. All
in all the work due for M18 was done and the overall
feedback was very positive from our Project Officer and reviewers. See
Nicolas Thiéry's
[debriefing notes](http://opendreamkit.org/2017/04/26/first-project-review-debriefing/)
for more information.

### 2nd amendment

This amendment catered for the respective move of Michael Kohlhase and
Hans Fangohr and their respective teams to new institutions. This led
to the addition of to locations (FAU and XFEL) respectively and the
termination of Southampton.

### Workplan revisions and 3rd amendment

At the occasion of the review, we were strongly encouraged to propose
revisions to our work plan, based on our latest vision of the project
and its landscape, in order to maximize the effectiveness and impact
of our resources.

UPSud led the process, getting work package and site leaders involved,
as well as our advisory board. Our proposals were accepted with very
minor changes by the reviewers and implemented in a third amendment to
the grant agreement:

- new milestones were added, Key Performance Indicators were modified
- Objective 6 (social studies) canceled
- T7.4 integrated in T2.8
- T7.1, T7.2 and T7.3 cancelled and related resources were transfered in favour of T2.6, T3.3, T3.3 and T5.7
- Remaining work on WP7 moved to other work packages
- Consolidation of deliverables to reduce their number

This amendment was the occasion to officially terminate Jacobsuni and
UZH where all resources had been spent and no personnel remained.

All changes were implemented in the [github repository](https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/).

The amendment is about to be completed with the signature of the
Commission. UPSUD will make an announcement and make public the new
version of the Grant when it is signed.

## Work in progress

### OpenDreamKit and EOSC

* Strategy: last November, N. Thiéry, B. Pilorget, and H. Fangohr
  participated to two events in Brussels dedicated to the the future
  European Open Science Cloud (EOSC). We aimed at understanding this
  future network and what opportunities it offered for our
  communities. A [blogpost](http://opendreamkit.org/2017/12/06/EOSC/)
  was written on the matter. For the time being, ODK has not yet
  expressed official support to EOSC. The steering committee is
  welcome to express their interest or disinterest in this project.

* Partnership with EGI (main stakeholder of the EOSC): there is an
  ongoing collaboration between EGI and OpenDreamKit for the
  JupyterHub and BinderHub-based EGI services. Proofs of concepts for
  both have been deployed by Enol Fernandez from EG. To proceed
  further, a Technology Provider Agreement must be signed between EGI
  and OpenDreamKit/Jupyter developers in the next weeks. Depending on
  the success of this joint work and of the need of the EOSC
  post-2020, the collaboration could be extended.

### Portability and build system for SageMath

- Finalization of Cygwin's port of SageMath [https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/issues/66].
  See Erik's [blog post](http://opendreamkit.org/2017/10/11/SageWindows/).
  Report to be finished and submitted soon.

### Misc technical achievements

- Work on WP4: enabling binder and ThebeLab for SageMath, for live
  documentation, reproducible notebooks, etc.

- Work on WP5: HPC for combinatorics

### Communication strategy

The outcome of the three trainees' work will be an improvement of the communcation of ODK towards outside the consortium.
Will be impacted: the website, KPIs (mostly success stories for which media is required). The first visible action to the consortium were polls sent our to participants: a [poll for thematics](https://pluquetelisabeth.typeform.com/to/uTnjIQ) and a [poll about the website and project](https://pluquetelisabeth.typeform.com/to/lzujKT) in general. The first answers are currently being looked into.

## ODK Use Cases

For the first time this year, we used a *Jupyter Hub* and
the newly developed *Cling C++ kernel* in our 300 students
[introductory programming course](http://nicolas.thiery.name/Enseignement/Info111/)
at Paris Sud. This was the occasion to test those technologies both
from a technical and pedagogical point of view. We contributed back
through many bug reports and feature requests.
