Suggestions from Paul: 
 - skim over sage databases (i.e. mention they exist, not more)
 - talk about different uses of category framework, including Florent's tricks of adding new axions to check consistency
 = talk about persistence/pickling of math objects as one point where semantics are implicit


1. Overview at a high level of your system

 Give a 5 minute talk about the mathematics we need to grasp what you are trying to achieve with your system. This means introducing the concepts that are important, focusing on how they relate, rather than their definition. This is not concerned with questions of implementation of your system, yet. 

1. What data do you have?
 1. Structure
 1. Format
 1. How is it produced?
 1. How is it changed?
 1. How do you document it?

1. What knowledge do you have?
 1. Sources of external knowledge?
 1. Can you point to implicit knowledge? Is it common knowledge?
 1. What would you gain if it was made explicit/machine actionable?
 1. Have you gone in this direction? How did you represent the knowledge then?
 1. How do you collaborate on knowledge representation? 

1. What software do you have?
 1. What custom software are you running?
 1. In which language?
 1. How does it use the data and the knowledge?
 1. How does your software act on represented knowledge?
 
1. Mixing (revisit?)
 1. Which knowledge is implicit in the data you have?
 1. Which knowledge is implicit in the software you have?

1. Anything else?
