## Financial and administrative setup
First expenses done

## Hiring
Jan Aksamit has hired part time and performed some preparatory work on [D2.8: Demonstrator: Linear Algebra - interactive book].

## Achievements

We will probably start working on demonstrators [D2.9: Demonstrator: Nonlinear Processes in Biology interactive book] and [D2.14: Demonstrators: Problems in Physics with Sage, Computational Mathematics for Engineering] (Physics in Sage part) till summer 2016. The work on [D2.8] has already started and we will commit some texts in next months. 

Demonstrator [D2.8: Demonstrator: Linear Algebra - interactive book] will start as sphinx  book with sagecell code cells. The reason is, that its due date is in the middle of the project (I mean it is soon for a demonstrator). If there will be any better solution we will adapt.  The first commits should be avaiable in next months.

We have created a funcional prototype od 3d jupyter widget, which will be presented on SD74 in Paris. 
Note that it has been funded from another source, thus we have whole amount of subcontracting amount available for its development. Perhaps the best way to go would be start the first subcontracting task after meeting in Paris in May/June. 
More importantly, we have estabilished very successfull collaboration with a team, which likely will continue the development of K3D

Source of the code is on: [K3d-jupyter](https://github.com/K3D-tools/K3D-jupyter)

## Main upcoming tasks and deliverables

Nothing is urgent, perhaps next big movement would be to subcontract c.a. 50% of  K3D software.

-    Due month 24:
  - [D2.8: Demonstrator: Linear Algebra - interactive book]
  - [D4.12: Jupyter extension for 3D visualisation]
