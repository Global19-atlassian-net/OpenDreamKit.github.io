## Achievements

We will probably start working on demonstrators [D2.9] and [D.14] till summer 2016. The work on [D2.8] has already started and we will commit some texts in next months. 

Demonstrator [D2.8] willstart as  rst book with sagecell technology, since it due date is in the middle of the project (I mean it is soon for a demonstrator). If there will be any better solution we will adapt.  The first commits should be avaiable in next months.

We have created a funcional prototype od 3d jupyter widget, which will be presented on SD74 in Paris. 
Note that it has been funded from another source, thus we have whole amount of subcontracting amount avaiable for its development. Perhaps the best way to go would be start the first subcontracting task after meeting in Paris in May/June. 
More importantly, we have estabilished very successfull collaboration with a team, which likely will continue the development of K3D

## Main upcoming tasks and deliverables

Nothing is urgent, perhaps next big movement would be to subcontract c.a. 50% of  K3D software.
