## Achievements

-   [D2.2: Community building: Impact of development workshops,
      dissemination and training activities, year 1]
      (https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/issues/42)

    -   3-hour presentation and Sagemath tutorial following
        [GAP Software Carpentry Lesson](http://alex-konovalov.github.io/gap-lesson/) at
        [1st CoDiMa Training School in Computational Discrete Mathematics]
        (http://www.codima.ac.uk/school2015/)
    -   Oxford at the moment not featured in this WP - should be adjusted?

-   [D3.9: Semantic-aware Sage interface to GAP]
      (https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/issues/68)

    -   progress on tighter integration of Sage and GAP via libGAP
    -   preparing libGAP for GAP 4.8 update basically done.

-   [D7.1: The flow of code and patches in open source projects]
      (https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/issues/148)

    -   preparations (admin, etc) for an experiment to be held in Summer 2016
        (10-12 students coding in a Sage summer project)

-   [D6.?, D7.?: Database of strongly regular graphs]

    -   did a lot of Sage coding to implement constrictions cited in
        [the database](http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/graphs/srg/srgtab.html)

    -   Completed and submitted [preprint](http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.00181)

    -   interesting experiences with bugs and wrong constructions in the literature, perhaps
        to be analysed in some way.

## Main upcoming tasks and deliverables

-   [D2.2: Community building: Impact of development workshops,
      dissemination and training activities, year 1]
      (https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/issues/42)

    -   (NEW!) Creating  [Sage Software Carpentry Lesson](http://alex-konovalov.github.io/sage-lesson/)
        jointly with St.Andrews: other contributors most welcome!

-   [D7.1: The flow of code and patches in open source projects]
      (https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/issues/148)

    -   an experiment to be held in Summer 2016, 10-12 students coding in a Sage summer project,
        mostly on families of ellliptic curves (with Jennifer Balakrishnan) and probably also
        combinatorics (with Dima Pasechnik)

-   [D7.5: Report on relevant research in sociology of mathematics and lessons for design of
     OpenDreamKit VRE, part I] (https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/issues/148)

    - behind the schedule due to external personnel/collaborators issues
