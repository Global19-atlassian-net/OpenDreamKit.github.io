## Financial and administrative setup

- Everything on rails: money arrived, first expenses done, we were even allowed to use some of the overhead.

- Signature of the consortium agreement is a bit of a labyrinth but finally it looks like it will be done
  soon!

---
## Hiring

-  None: only 2 reasonable candidates among the 20 auditions and they did not take the job. Will perform
   another recruitment session this summer.
