## Monday 25th

### Mission statement

- [Knowledge first strategy](/meetings/2016-01-25-DKS/Kohlhase_slides.pdf) (Michael)

### State of the art

The idea here is that we efficiently collect and share information about knowledge representation in the various systems. NOT to present the systems in general. Therefore we will only ask presenters to structure their (half-hour) presentation accoring to [this survey](survey-generic.md).

- Knowledge representation in FindStat (Viviane)
- Knowledge representation in LMFDB (Paul)
- Knowledge representation in GAP: the GAP category system (Markus)
- Knowledge representation in Sage: [Categories/theories in Sage](../survey-Sage/) (Nicolas)
  ([demo](../survey-Sage.ipynb))
- A proof-of-concept Knowledge-aware Sage-GAP interface: presentation of the outcome of the coding sprint during the GAP/Sage days (Nicolas)
- Current practice: commonalities in "dumping math data on the web" process (FindStat, LMFDB,...)

### Tutorial

The idea for this session is to see how knowledge representation in [MMT](https://svn.kwarc.info/repos/MMT/doc/html/index.html) could serve as a generic knowledge backbone for integrating the various systems. 

- Tutorial for MMT (Florian & Michael)

## Tuesday 26th

### Oxford partner presentation (catch up on the kick-off meeting)

### [Steering committee meeting](../SteeringCommittee/agenda/) (10:30 local time)

### Brainstorms and coding sprints

- Proof of concept OMDoc/MMT theory for simple Python
- Proof of concept OMDoc/MMT theory for Sage categories
- Proof of concept OMDoc/MMT theory for GAP categories
- Proof of concept OMDoc/MMT theory for FindStat
- Proof of concept category-aware Sage-GAP interface built automatically from the above

## Wednesday 27th

# Preparation for the workshop
- Docker image of MMT
- Sample theories for each of FindStat knowledge domain, LMFDB knowledge domain, categories
