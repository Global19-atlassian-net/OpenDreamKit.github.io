This community building and training conference aims to bring together
users and developers of (open source) (pure) mathematics software,
including GAP, Linbox, MPIR, Pari/GP, SageMath, or Singular. Following
a long trend of highly productive workshops within the various
communities (e.g. the Sage-Days series), this conference will consist
of keynote talks and hands on tutorials with a focus on experimental
research and computational and development best practices; and plenty
of free time for interactions and collaborative work.

This conference is organized by the H2020 European project
OpenDreamKit, of which it will be the main public closing event.

Keynote speakers:

- Marie-Françoise Roy (Université de Rennes 1)
  A historical perspective on contributions of researchers and teachers to (open source) mathematical software
- Max Horn (Justus-Liebig-Universität Gießen)
  Collaborative software development in a large system (GAP)
- Fernando Perez (Berkeley Institute for Data Science, California) 
  Scientific computing, user interfaces, and community building
- Anne Schilling (UC Davis California)
  Impact of computer assisted experimentation in combinatorics
- Joris Van Der Hoeven (Ecole Polytechnique)
  General purpose mathematical software design
