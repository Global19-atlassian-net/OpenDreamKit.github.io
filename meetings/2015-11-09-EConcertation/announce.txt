Dear project coordinators and project partners,

We would like to invite you to the 11th e-concertation meeting for European e-infrastructure projects that will take place in Brussels on the 9th of November 2015
The objective of the e-concertation meeting is to you bring together to discuss present issues related to the implementation of the first Horizon 2020 projects and future activities in light of the soon to be adopted Work Programme 2016-2017.
We will have a strong focus on the cooperation between project via the project groups that have been set-up to foster cooperation among e-infrastructures projects and share experiences and best practices. These groups will be expected to work together during the e-concertation meeting to find synergies enabling them to satisfy the new requirements and to efficiently address the challenges ahead.
We strongly encourage the participation of project partners to the event as it will widen the debates and stimulate cooperation between all actors of the European e-infrastructures.
We will also discuss other issues we consider more relevant, such as KPIs, TRLs and catalogue of services.

In the meantime, may we remind you that our new platform<http://ec.europa.eu/d4science> Digital4Science is available to launch pre-meeting discussions. If you have not done it yet, please register and engage with the e-infrastructures community.
