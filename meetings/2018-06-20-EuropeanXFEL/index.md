# How to come

Although the European XFEL is in Schenefeld, it is very easy to reach it both from the Hamburg Airport, Main Train Station (Hauptbahnhof), and central Hamburg. To plan your local journey, you can visit [HVV](http://www.hvv.de/en/), enter your starting station and use "Schenefeld, Aneken" as your final stop.

Tickets can be bought at all S-Bahn and U-Bahn stations (cards and cash accepted) as well as from the bus driver (change given). In addition, you can also get a ticket using [HVV-App](http://www.hvv.de/fahrplaene/hvv-app/), but you will need to create an account.
