- Word of welcome and brief overview (Nicolas 10 min)

- Consortium (45 minutes)

  3 minutes presentation of each site by its leader (main themes,
  expertise, ressources) and self-introduction of each participant
  (involvement in particular projects, specific expertise or
  interests).

- 5 minute presentation of each work package by its leader:

  - WP2: Community building, training, Dissemination, Outreach (Viviane Pons)
  - WP3: Component Architecture (Luca De Feo)
  - WP4: User Interfaces (Min Ragan-Kelley?)
  - WP5: High Performance Mathematical Computing (Clément Pernet)
  - WP6: Data/Knowledge/Software bases (Michael Kohlhase)
  - WP7: Social aspects (Alexander Konovalov? Steve Linton?)

- Administrative aspects (Eugenia, Benoît) (1h):

  - Important administrative points: reporting, ... (10 min)

  - Review and discussion of the main aspects of the Consortium

## 3:30-4pm: Coffee break

## 4pm-6pm: Task presentations and projects planning

In this session, the main tasks of OpenDreamKit will be presented by
their respective leaders. The goal is to attract attention and get
participants involved. We will then start planning for the brainstorms
and coding sprints that will occur during the rest of the week.

## 8pm: Social dinner, tentatively at [Le Grammophone](http://www.legramophone.net/)

# Thursday - Saturday: brainstorms and coding sprints

## Jupyter kernels for all interactive computation software

GAP, Singular, Pari/GP, Linbox+CLING?, XCAS?, ...

Short presentation:
- Jupyter architecture and how to write kernels (Min RK)

## Exploring and further documenting Sage Math Cloud internals

## Component architecture

Potential targets:

- Docker containers for all computational software?
- Fix the remaining issues for Sage in docker
- ...

## HPC Brainstorm

Short presentations:
- Pythran (Serge Guelton)
- Parallel computing in Giac & XCas (Frédéric Han)
