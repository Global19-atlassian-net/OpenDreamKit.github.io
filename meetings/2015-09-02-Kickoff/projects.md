## Collaborative tools for OpenDreamKit: Thursday over lunch

Nicolas, Hans, Luca, Michael, ...

- Communication: mailing lists? Gitter? slack? OpenPaas?
- Private repositories
- Live collaboration: framapad, hubl.in, whiteboard, ...
- How do we want to track progress on the various tasks?
  Systematically open an issue on OpenDreamKit's github repo, possibly
  being just a link to some tracker elsewhere (e.g. Sage's trac
  server)
  - How to make lists of all tasks?
  - Could we create the issues automatically from the proposal?
  - Do we want a separate repo just for the tasks? Or per work package?
