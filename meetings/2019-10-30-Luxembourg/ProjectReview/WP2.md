## Our role

This workpackage has been the **link** between the work we do at OpenDreamKit and the **scientific communities**.

--
## Our role

- **Community building**: Organizing workshops and conferences to reinforce our communities
- **Training**: Widespread our shared technical knowledge especially concerning new OpenDreamKit development
- **Dissemination and outreach**: communicate about our achievments, foster larger communities
- **Exploitation**: make effective use of OpenDreamKit development in science and research 

---
## Communication

**How to convey what has been done by the OpenDreamKit project?** We describe technichal solutions through various use cases.

**How did the fact that the event was targeted to women impact your decision to come?**

 * *It helped, made me feel more encouraged to apply*
 * *It was my first workshop in Europe so I felt more comfortable working with women first but now I think I can go to any kind of workshop.*

*This was the first time I didnâ€™t have imposter syndrome since starting my PhD. Everyone was so welcoming and there was an understanding that we were all from different backgrounds and with different levels of experience. It felt very easy to make suggestions and ask questions without the fear of being judged.*

## Conclusion

 * We do more than organizing events, we foster a community
 * These events will continue after the end of the project, depending on local resources, other projects, etc.
 
--
## Some remarks

 * These events **don't cost a lot** in terms of money
 * But they cost in terms of **time** and **administration**
 * The easiest access to the money, the easiest the admin, the easiest it is to make these events accessible to those who really need them.
 
--

We need **active actions** to create diversity, we need **motivated people** and we need to **support them**.
