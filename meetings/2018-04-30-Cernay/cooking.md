This was the organisation page for the cooking at the
[workshop on Low level interfaces with libraries](https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/issues/251 )

## Dishes

- Nicolas: crèpes (flour 2-4kg, 6l milk, sausages, cheese, honey, ...)
- Serge : krampouezh ++ : together with Nicolas, I can prepare crêpes with black flour. Should I bring ar bilig ? (so 2 - 4 kg of black flour + eggs + cheese + onion...)

- Thomas: bean soup,
                    can be prepared for 20 people if all are willing to eat this,
                    is in principle vegetarian but who likes can eat a sausage to it;
                    required material for 10 people:
                        1 kg dry beans (which have to be put into water one night in advance),
                        1 kg potatoes, 250 g onions, 250 g carrots, 250 g celery root, 250 g leek, 
                        sausages if wanted,
                        oil, salt, pepper, summer savory, ...

- Robert: Coconut Curry

    Easy to scale to however many people

    I generally add chicken, but we can cook that to the side and add it to part of the pot later

    For 20 people:

    ~12 cans coconut milk

    3-4 medium onions, several zucchini, yellow squash, etc. a potato or two, mushrooms and other fresh vegetables.

    chicken (depending on the vegetarian/non ratio)

    Ginger, curry powder, salt pepper, oil

    Serve over rice


- Robert: Taco salad

- Sebastian: Cheese-Leek-Soup (can be done veggie or not): https://www.chefkoch.de/rezepte/982031203667502/Kaese-Lauch-Suppe-mit-Hackfleisch.html?portionen=20 or https://www.chefkoch.de/rezepte/2452401386241414/Kaese-Lauch-Suppe-mit-Soja-Hack.html?portionen=20

- Stefan:
    Potatoes, celery, carrots, zucchini, leek, onions - all sound good. Just get plenty of them and we'll find something to eat and cook.
    I'd add a couple of different forms of pasta, sieved tomatoes, some fast cooking (red) lentils, as well some chili peppers and garlic to that list (hmm, sounds like we could also make a lentil bolognese from that - suggests Fusilli as pasta).

- Hadrien: Asparaguses + vinaigrette & some strawberries for dessert?

- Jeroen: Belgian fries to add to whatever dish. The combination with the barbecue last year was great IMHO.

- Jim Pivarski: baked ziti. Requires penne noodles, some vegetables (green and red peppers, onions, mushrooms, a little garlic, etc. are all good), a hearty, meltable cheese, maybe cheddar, olive oil, a tiny amount of balsamic vinegar, and enough pans to bake enough for everybody.

## Diet restrictions or preferences

- Nicolas: I very much enjoy vegetarian
- Stefan+Gabriele: vegetarians (which is neither a diet nor a restriction, but well... ;) )
- Jeroen: strong dislike of vinegar/vinaigrette/mayonnaise/ketchup (not an allergy)
- Sebastian: Does not eat fish
