title: "Workshop on Low level interfaces with libraries: program"
---

This was the program for the
[workshop on Low level interfaces with libraries](https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/issues/251 )
It was constructed on the fly according to the participants
wishes and project evolutions. Roughly speaking, the plan was to have
brief show-and tell sessions early in the week to kick start
discussions. The rest of the time was be devoted to brainstorms,
tutorials, and coding sprints with regular projects planning and
debriefing sessions.


## Monday afternoon 15:00-19:00

Presentations: use cases and experience reports from library interface developers, and tools

- Interfaces in SageMath, with a focus on Pari/GP: cypary2 (Jeroen Demeyer)
- libsemigroups (James Mitchell)
- Object-array mapping and columnar data granularity (Jim)
- xtensor and bindings (Johan Mabille / Sylvain Corlay / Wolf Vollprecht)
- xeus-cling / xwidgets (Johan Mabille / Sylvain Corlay / Wolf Vollprecht)
- Root / cling (Enrico Guiraud?)
- Numba (Antoine Pitrou)
- pythran (Serge Guelton)

20:30: project discussion and a drink
21pm: dinner

## Tuesday morning

7:30: greeting the sun in the garden / run / ...
8:00: breakfast

9:30-12: more presentations

- GAP / Julia interface? (Sebastian)

    I can show how the interface is organized and what we have achieved to far, specially how we can make compiled julia funcs available in GAP, and what we did to use GAP data in Julia


    I would do a live demo and scroll through some interesting code, probably accompanied with very few slides. So this might take about 30 minutes, depending on the number of questions

- some use cases for the GAP-Julia Interface (Thomas)
  (live demo in GAP, about 15 minutes)

- dragonffi (Adrien Guinet)

- interfaces in PolyMake (Andreas?)

- A HEP tracking use case for xtensor (Hadrien)

- PyNormaliz ? (Sebastian) 
- fast callable: generate C code from symbolic expression (?)
- Arrow, PEP 574 (pickle protocol with out-of-band data) (Antoine Pitrou)
- Cython (Robert Bradshaw?)
- please add yours!
