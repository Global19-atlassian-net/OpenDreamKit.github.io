## Achievements

K3D-jupyter 
 - project was ported to ipywidgets 7, 
 - last version is (v 2.4.18), 
 - API is  stable
 - it has been used by FutureProcessing (https://www.future-processing.com) by teams involved in data analysis and simulation and cfd analysis.
 - the latest version is included in pip: 
 	
	pip install k3d
	jupyter nbextension install --py --sys-prefix k3d
	jupyter nbextension enable --py --sys-prefix k3d

## Work in progress

K3d-jupyter widget is under final stage of development which includes:

 - polishing existing features, performance optimalization
 - CFD analysis module.
 - There have been significant improvement in volumetric rendering

There has been done work on demonstrator  "Problems in Physics".

Demonstrator Linear Algebra  and Nonlinear processes in Biology are in last stage of development.
