## Achievements

In the reporting period most work in Oxford has been towards portability of Sage and its components,
with patches contributed to MPIR, MPFR, Singular, GAP, PPL, Flint, Arb, Scipy, as well as Sage itself.
Most time was devoted to porting to clang (very important for support of Sage on OSX), and
work on MPIR and libGAP.

Pasechnik co-mentored two Google Summer of Code (GSoC) students in the summer of 2018, which resulted in
improving graph theory and coding theory components of Sage. (He was also an admin for the 2018 GSoC for SageMath).

## Work in progress

Ports of Sage to FreeBSD and Solaris have been revived, and are well underway.
Other projects are related to improving optimisation
capabilities of Sage, as well as capabilites to generate graphs and other combinatorial objects.

He also is doing work on Sage modularisation.

## Workshops and dissemination activities

Pasechnik attended a number of ODK and ODK-related workshops and meetings, and gave Sage-related
talks at a coneference at Pilsen and seminars at Oxford and Warwick.
He helps with using Sage in teaching at Oxford's Mathematical Institute.
