We picked the

It has reasonably priced rooms, which can also be shared with 2-3
people. Please book and pay your rooms and breakfast yourselves. We
did not reserve any rooms so you should do this reasonably soon.

Sunday and Wednesday we will be meeting in the hotel. To order coffee
breaks and lunch, we need you to indicate your presence by Oct. 17 at

On Monday and Tuesday, a room will be provided for us in the EU
building in the center of Luxembourg: EUFO building, 10, rue Robert
Stumper, L-2557, room: 0170.
