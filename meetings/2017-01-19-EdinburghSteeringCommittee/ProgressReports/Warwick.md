## Financial and administrative setup

- Administration all going smoothly

- John Cremona is currently the only participant at Warwick

---

## Activities 1/2

- John Cremona was on study leave from mid-September to mid-December
  2015, spending much of that time working on LMFDB matters relevant
  to WP6.

- Work on LMFDB (funded externally by EPSRC and ICERM) has included
  better documentation of the database contents (constituent
  databases and collections, definition of data fields and types)
  towards Task 6.8 (LMFDB Case Study), part of WP6.

---

## Activities 2/2

- Contribution to Task 6.1 (Survey of existing DKS bases, Formulation
  of requirements).

- Contribution to draft Data Management Plan.

- Attending St Andrews workshop, working with Michael Kohlhase and his
  research group and Paul-Olivier Dehaye on using MMT to provide a new
  way to access / view LMFDB data, starting with elliptic curves over
  Q, following on from work done by Michael together with Paul-Olivier
  Dehaye (Zurich).

##Hiring

- The 24-month post of Research Software Engineer (as in the proposal)
  was advertised in December 2016 with a closing date of 26 January
  2017.  Cooperation with Warwick's Centre for Scientific Computing
  enabled the post to be advertised as permanent and at a higher level
  than in the proposal; this is good, but caused a delay of several
  months.

- Once appointed the RSE will work approximately 0.8FTE for ODK for
  the remaining 30 months, until 31 August 2019.
