## Financial and administrative setup

- Everything on rails: money arrived, first expenses done

---
## Hiring

-   Dima Pasechnik (50%)
    - Start: immediate
    - Duration: until end of project
    - Has less other funding than expected year ago, only till Oct 2016
    - Will appreciate and absorb unused funds from other ODK sites

---
## Achievements I

-   [D2.2: Community building: Impact of development workshops, dissemination and training activities, year 1](https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/issues/42)
    -   3-hour presentation and Sagemath tutorial following
        [GAP Software Carpentry Lesson](http://alex-konovalov.github.io/gap-lesson/) at
        [1st CoDiMa Training School in Computational Discrete Mathematics](http://www.codima.ac.uk/school2015/)
#    -   Oxford at the moment not featured in this WP - should be adjusted?

-   [D3.9: Semantic-aware Sage interface to GAP](https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/issues/68)
    -   progress on tighter integration of Sage and GAP via libGAP
    -   libGAP for GAP 4.8 update done. Working on the update for GAP 4.9.

---
## Achievements II

-   [D7.1: The flow of code and patches in open source projects](https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/issues/148)
    -   preparations (admin, etc) for an experiment to start next week; 
        (8 students coding in a Sage summer project)

-   D6.?, D7.?: Database of strongly regular graphs
    -   did a lot of Sage coding to implement constrictions cited in
        [the database](http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/graphs/srg/srgtab.html)
    -   Completed [preprint](http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.00181), which is accepted for publication
        as of last week. (Reviewers went WILD, one of them calling this work Monumental...)
    -   interesting experiences with bugs and wrong constructions in the literature
        (to be analysed in some way?)
    -   Brings reproducibility of mathematical results afore.

-   D6.?, D7.?: Database of locally toroidal polytopes
    -   found gaps in the literature ("classical" work by P.McMullen and E.Schulte) - using GAP.
    -   Completed [preprint]() and submitted for publication.
    -   Brings reproducibility of mathematical results afore.

## Main upcoming tasks and deliverables (WP2)

-   [D2.2: Community building: Impact of development workshops, dissemination and training activities, year 1](https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/issues/42)
    -   Creating  [Sage Software Carpentry Lesson](http://alex-konovalov.github.io/sage-lesson/)
        jointly with St.Andrews: other contributors most welcome!

---
## Main upcoming tasks and deliverables (WP7)

-   [D7.1: The flow of code and patches in open source projects](https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/issues/148)
    -   an experiment will start next week, 8 students coding in a Sage summer project, on families of ellliptic curves (with Jennifer Balakrishnan) and combinatorics (with Dima Pasechnik)
 
-   [D7.5: Report on relevant research in sociology of mathematics and lessons for design of ODK VRE, part I](https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/issues/148)
    - [annotated bibliography](https://github.com/dimpase/abib/raw/master/annotated_bibliography.pdf) ready
#    - behind the schedule due to external personnel/collaborators issues

-   [D7.6: Game-theoretic analysis of development practices in open-source VREs](https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/issues/154)
    - [Studying science citation indices using game theory](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2936934)
