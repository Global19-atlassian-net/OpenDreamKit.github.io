## Financial and administrative setup

- Everything on track, but... 
- Change of guard in view of Ursula Martin stepping down in Sept 2016.

---
## Hiring

-   Dima Pasechnik (50%)
    - Start: immediate
    - Duration: until end of project
    - Has less other funding than expected in 2015, only till Oct 2016;
      has to work on a totally irrelevant to ODK short-term programming
      project for the other 50%, this will end in Feb 2017.
    - Will appreciate and absorb unused funds from other ODK sites

## Achievements I

-   [D2.2: Community building: Impact of development workshops, dissemination and training activities, year 1](https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/issues/42)
    -   3-hour presentation and Sagemath tutorial following
        [GAP Software Carpentry Lesson](http://alex-konovalov.github.io/gap-lesson/) at
        [1st CoDiMa Training School in Computational Discrete Mathematics](http://www.codima.ac.uk/school2015/)

-   [D3.9: Semantic-aware Sage interface to GAP](https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/issues/68)
    -   progress on tighter integration of Sage and GAP via libGAP
    -   libGAP for GAP 4.8 update done. Should work on an update for GAP 4.9, 
        and compatibility with GAP kernel packages.

---
## Achievements II

-   [D7.1: The flow of code and patches in open source projects](https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/issues/148)
    - Identified suitable tools, and currently experimenting them to produce a report.

-   [D7.2: TRAC add-on to manage ticket prioritisation](https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/issues/149)
    - There are suitable TRAC plugins to deploy, although they might need minor adjustments.

---
## Achievements III

-   D6.?, D7.?: Database of strongly regular graphs
    -   did a lot of Sage coding to implement constrictions cited in
        [the database](http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/graphs/srg/srgtab.html)
    -   Completed [paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.00181).
    -   Brings reproducibility of mathematical results afore.

-   D6.?, D7.?: Database of locally toroidal polytopes
    -   found gaps in the literature ("classical" work by P.McMullen and E.Schulte) - using GAP.
    -   Completed [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.01710) and submitted for publication.
    -   Brings reproducibility of mathematical results afore.

## WP7 upcoming tasks and deliverables

-   [D7.1: The flow of code and patches in open source projects](https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/issues/148)
    - Experimenting with analysing Sage and GAP github repositories using [foss-heartbeat](https://github.com/sarahsharp/foss-heartbeat) on "health of the community". While this might suffice to make a minimal kind of deliverable, more discussion is needed. 

-   Should we re-focus on something we have experience in?

---
## WP7 tasks and deliverables in progress

-   [D7.5: Report on relevant research in sociology of mathematics and lessons for design of ODK VRE, part I](https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/issues/148)
    - [annotated bibliography](https://github.com/dimpase/abib/raw/master/annotated_bibliography.pdf) ready-but unclear copyright.

-   [D7.6: Game-theoretic analysis of development practices in open-source VREs](https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/issues/154)
    - [Studying science citation indices using game theory](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2936934)
