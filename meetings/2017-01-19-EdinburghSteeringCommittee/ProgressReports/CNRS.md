## Financial and administrative setup

- Everything on rails: money arrived, first expenses done,
  we were even allowed to use some of the overhead.

- Going back and forth between laboratory administration and
  CNRS is a bit of a nightmare. But with patience, things
  get done.

## Hiring

- failed to recruit an engineer on time: only two reasonable
  candidates among the 20 interviews and they did not take the job
  (September 2015). We are in the process of hiring an engineer for
  September 2016.
