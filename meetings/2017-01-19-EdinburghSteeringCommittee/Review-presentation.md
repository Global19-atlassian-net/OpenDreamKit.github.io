    - At least one representative per site

    - Discussion among the reviewers

## Advice for deliverable presentations

Presentations during the review should contain:

- Short and striking story about the relevance and goal of the deliverable
- State of the art at beginning of project
- What was achieved, by ODK / by the community
- Partners are involved, estimate of resources used (i.e. number of PMs if possible) and how much ODK helped to this result
- Brief description of current activities, future outcomes and plans
- Any reference to the Proposal is welcome

---

## General advice

- You don't have to answer general/administrative questions

  Ex: for a question concerning the methodology of an institution, a lab can send the question to the relevant institution administration

- If you are not certain of the answer, do not hesitate to request
  time to give clarification

---

## Grades

The Consortium will be graded according to this scale:

- 4/4: Excellent progress (objectives and technical goals for the period fully achieved and even exceeded expectations)
- 3/4: Good progress (most of objectives and technical goals achieved for the period with relatively minor deviations)
- 2/4: Acceptable progress (some of its objectives achieved; however, corrective action will be required)
- 1/4: Unsatisfactory progress (the project has failed to achieve key objectives and/or is not at all on schedule) = project is cancelled

---

## Periodic Reports

- Periodic technical report (coordination team)

    - starting point: D1.3's report

    - fleshed up to 2-3 pages per work package, typically by giving a
      longer description of the deliverables

- Periodic financial report (UPSud finance department and other admins)

Deadline:

- officially 60 days after the 28/02/2017
- BUT will have to be over for the Review

=> PLANNING WILL BE DONE WHEN DATE IS KNOWN
