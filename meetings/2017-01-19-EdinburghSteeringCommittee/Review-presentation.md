## Tentative agenda 1/2
- A three day event
    - Day 1: Mock presentations (just like for the review but without Reviewers)
    - Day 2: Project meetings (Steering, Quality Review Board...)
    - Day 3: Official Review

+ Coding sprints may be added to that

---

## Tentative agenda 2/2

- Presence: WP leaders + Coordinator + project manager (At least: 1 participant per partner)

- The meeting normally lasts one day with the following tentative agenda:
    - Welcome and tour de table
    - General introduction by the Coordinator 
    - Presentation on WPs and related deliverables
    - Presentation on dissemination, management, and use of resources
    - Discussion among the monitors and presentation of a brief assessment presentation

---

## When and where

- Either in Gent or in Brussel

- Most probably end of April, beginning of May: the date depends on the reviewers' availabilities

---

## Advice for deliverables presentation

Presentations during the Review should contain:

- Which partners are involved
- How many/much project resources have been used (i.e. number of PMs if possible) and how much ODK helped to this result
- What you are supposed to do in the project frame
- Where you have started
- What you have done in the deliverable
- Shortly describe further outcomes, current activities, future plans
- Any reference to the Proposal is welcome 

---

## Grades

The Consortium can expect to be graded following this scale:

- 4/4: Excellent progress (objectives and technical goals for the period fully achieved and even exceeded expectations)
- 3/4: Good progress (most of objectives and technical goals achieved for the period with relatively minor deviations)
- 2/4: Acceptable progress (some of its objectives achieveed; however, corrective action will be required)
- 1/4: Unsatisfactory progress (the project has failed to achieve key objectives and/or is not at all on schedule) = project is cancelled

---

## General advice

- Do NOT answer general questions
    - Ex: for a question concerning the methodology of an institution, a lab can send the question to the relevant institution administration
 
- If you are not certain of the answer, do not hesitate to ask for some time to give clarification

## Periodic Reports

Officially 60 days after the 28/02/2017 to deliver periodic reports		
    -> BUT will have to be over for the Review

- Periodic technical report (By coordinator and sites)
- Periodic financial report (prepared and written by UPSud finance department and other admins)
