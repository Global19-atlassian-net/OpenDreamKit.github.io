    - At least one representative per site

    - General introduction by the coordinator

       - WP leader presenting + if necessary deliverable leaders
       - Duration per WP: depending of the amount of content to present

    - Presentation on dissemination, management, and use of resources
    - Discussion among the reviewers
    - Brief assessment by the reviewers

## Advice for WP & Deliv. presentations

Presentations during the review should contain:

- In a slide presentation

    - State of the art at beginning of project for the Work Package
    - Short and striking story about the relevance and goal of the deliverable
    - Give involved partners, estimate resources used (i.e. number of PMs if possible) and how much ODK helped to this result

--

- In the most appropriate format

    - What was achieved, by ODK / by the community
    - Brief description of current activities, future outcomes and plans

- Any reference to the Proposal is welcome (graphs, WP or deliverable descriptions etc.)

---

## General advice

- You don't have to answer general/administrative questions

  Ex: for a question concerning the methodology of an institution, a lab can send the question to the relevant institution administration

- If you are not certain of the answer, do not hesitate to request
  time to give clarification

---

## Grades

The Consortium can expect to be graded according to this scale:

- 4/4: Excellent progress (objectives and technical goals for the period fully achieved and even exceeded expectations)
- 3/4: Good progress (most of objectives and technical goals achieved for the period with relatively minor deviations)
- 2/4: Acceptable progress (some of its objectives achieveed; however, corrective action will be required)
- 1/4: Unsatisfactory progress (the project has failed to achieve key objectives and/or is not at all on schedule) = project is cancelled

---

## Periodic Reports

- Periodic technical report (coordination team)

    - starting point: D1.3's report
    - fleshed up to 2-3 pages per work package, typically by giving a
      longer description of the deliverables
    - Goal: give an exhaustive and concise  sum up of the 1st Reporting Period results

- Periodic financial report (UPSud finance department and other admins)

--

- Deadline:

    - Officially 60 days after the 28/02/2017
    - BUT will have to be over for the Review

=> PLANNING WILL BE DONE WHEN DATE IS KNOWN
