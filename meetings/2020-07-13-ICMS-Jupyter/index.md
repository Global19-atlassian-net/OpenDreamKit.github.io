A session at [ICMS](http://icms-conference.org/2020), Braunchweig, Germany July 13-16, 2020

### Session organizers

*   [Nicolas M. Thiéry](mailto:Nicolas.Thiery@u-psud.fr) (Université Paris-Sud / Paris-Saclay)
*   Coorganizer welcome! Please get in touch if interested.

### Aim and Scope

The last years have seen the emergence of the open source web-based
interactive computing environment [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org)
(formerly IPython). Its flagship is the traditional notebook
application that allows you to create and share documents that contain
live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text; millions of
such notebooks have been published online. The main novelty of Jupyter
is that it can be used with dozens of programming languages, including
Julia, Python, R, Caml, C++, or Coq. 

Thanks to this level of generality and to the use of open standards
and modern web technologies, a wide ecosystem of related tools has
appeared, e.g. for interactive book and slides authoring, hosting,
collaborating, sharing, or publishing. Several mathematical systems
(e.g. GAP, SageMath, Singular, OSCAR) have already adopted it as user
interface of choice.

The purpose of this session is to review and discuss the merits (and
demerits!) of this ecosystem and its alternatives for mathematical
research and education, notably with open science and reproducibility
in mind.

It you would like to present a talk (~25 minutes), please submit!


##### Topics (including, but not limited to)

*   Overview of the Jupyter ecosystem
*   Use cases in Research and Education: demonstration and feedback from experience
*   Integration of computational systems and proof systems: demonstration and feedback from experience
*   Interactive mathematics with Jupyter widgets
*   Hands on mini tutorials

### Publications

*   A _short abstract_ will appear on the permanent conference web page (see below) as soon as accepted.  

*   An _extended abstract_ may be submitted for the conference proceedings that will be distributed during the meeting.

*   A **_journal special issue_ **consisting of _full papers_ will be organized immediately after the meeting.

### Submission Guidelines

*   If you would like to give a talk at ICMS, you need to submit first a short abstract and then later an extended abstract. See the [guideline](http://icms-conference.org/2020/call-for-submissions/) for the details.  

*   After the meeting, the submission guideline for a journal special issue will be communicated to you by the session organizers.
