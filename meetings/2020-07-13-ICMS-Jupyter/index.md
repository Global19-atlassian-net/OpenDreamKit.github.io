### Session organizers

*   [Nicolas M. Thiéry](http://Nicolas.Thiery.name/) (Université Paris-Sud / Paris-Saclay)
*   Coorganizer welcome! Please get in touch if interested.

### Aim and Scope

The last years have seen the emergence of the open source web-based
interactive computing environment [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org)
(formerly IPython). Its flagship is the traditional notebook
application that allows you to create and share documents that contain
live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text; millions of
such notebooks have been published online. The main novelty of Jupyter
is that it can be used with dozens of programming languages, including
Julia, Python, R, Caml, C++, or Coq.

Thanks to this level of generality and to the use of open standards
and modern web technologies, a wide ecosystem of related tools has
appeared, e.g. for interactive book and slides authoring, hosting,
collaborating, sharing, or publishing. Several mathematical systems
(e.g. GAP, SageMath, Singular, OSCAR) have already adopted it as user
interface of choice.

The purpose of this session is to review and discuss the merits (and
demerits!) of this ecosystem and its alternatives for mathematical
research and education, notably with open science and reproducibility
in mind.

It you would like to present a talk (~25 minutes), please submit!


##### Topics (including, but not limited to)

*   Overview of the Jupyter ecosystem
*   Use cases in Research and Education: demonstration and feedback from experience
*   Integration of computational systems and proof systems: demonstration and feedback from experience
*   Interactive mathematics with Jupyter widgets
*   Hands on mini tutorials

### Publications

*   A _short abstract_ will appear on the permanent conference web page (see below) as soon as accepted.

*   An _extended abstract_ may be submitted for the conference proceedings that will be distributed during the meeting.

*   A _journal special issue_ consisting of _full papers_ will be organized immediately after the meeting.

### Submission process

There are two levels of submissions (short and extended abstracts).
Going to Level 2 requires to go through Level 1 before.

Level 1: In order to give a presentation at ICMS 2020, submit a short
abstract (plain text, i.e., without using any mathematical symbols,
etc; 200 words max.) by February 24, 2020 via email to the [session
chair](mailto:Nicolas.Thiery@u-psud.fr).

We encourage that you submit it as soon as possible. If you submit
early, then you will get the decision early: the organizers will make
a decision within a week of submission. If accepted, then you will
give a talk at the session, and your abstract will appear on the
session web page immediately. Furthermore you may (if desired) proceed
to Level 2.

Level 2: You submit an extended abstract by March 16, 2016.  If
accepted, then it will enter the conference proceedings, which will
appear in the Springer series Lecture Notes in Computer Science
(LNCS). It should be at least 4 pages and at most 8 pages.  It should
follow the Springer guidelines for authors
  https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines
In particular, it should use the latex template and the LNCS latex
style. The extended abstracts must be submitted via EasyChair to
  https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icms2020
as a single file, containing all the files.  This must include one
LaTeX source file, one bib file with the references, and one PDF
created from the source.  If you should have TikZ graphics, include it
into the LaTeX source.  Additional graphics files may be added to the
zip file as PNG or JPG.

The extended abstracts shall contain original research that has
neither been published nor submitted for publication elsewhere.
Authors need to sign a Consent-to-Publish form, through which the
copyright of their paper is transferred to Springer.
